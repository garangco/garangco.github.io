The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.

What is creative art and why should you care?
Creative art is a form of art that uses imagination and creativity to create something new. By definition, creative art is any art that is created using the power of imagination and creativity. There are many types of creative art, including photography, painting, poetry, sculpture, and music. Each artist creates their own unique brand of creative art.
There are several reasons why you should care about creative art. First, creative artists often use their own imagination and creativity to create new works of art. This can be very rewarding because it allows them to explore their repertoire of skills in a way that they may not have been able to do with other forms of artistic expression. Second, creative artists often experiment with ideas and techniques that other artists might not consider. This can lead to interesting outcomes that you might not have found if you were just looking for traditional Approaches to Art.
