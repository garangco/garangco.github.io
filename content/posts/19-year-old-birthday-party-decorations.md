Tips for creative expression:
Creative expression is a key part of any creative person’s arsenal. Whether it’s painting, writing, filmmaking, or simply spending time outside, creativity is key to any creative process. However, there are a few tips that can help you get started on your creative journey. Here are some tips:
1. Find your voice: When you start out in the creative process, it can be difficult to find your unique voice. One way to do this is to think about what kind of art you want to create and how you want people to feel when they see it. This will help you find your artistic voice and become more confident with your work.

2. Practice: The second step in becoming more creative is practice. When you first start out, it can be hard to put your ideas into practice because they may not seem that important.
