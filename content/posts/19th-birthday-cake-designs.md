Conclusion
Innovation is a process, not an outcome.
Innovation is often mistaken for creativity or ingenuity, but it is much more than that. Innovation is a process of turning creative ideas into tangible products or services. It is the implementation of new ideas, not just the generation of them.

This process requires more than just individual creativity; it also demands teamwork, tenacity, and resourcefulness. Anyone can be innovative if they have the right mindset and are willing to put in the hard work.
