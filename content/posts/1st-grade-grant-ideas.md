Idea 2: We need to create more opportunities for people to learn
There are many ways that people can learn new things. Some people learn through books, others through conversation, and still others through online resources. In order to create more opportunities for people to learn, we should consider creating more interactive learning experiences. These experiences could include:
-Teams: A team learning experience is a great way for students to work together and learn from one another.Team building activities can be used in a variety of ways, such asctoring lectures or discussing research papers with classmates.

-Video Lessons: Adding video lessons into classrooms can help students learn by watching it instead of reading it. This type of learning is convenient because students have time to stop and watch the lesson while they are working on other tasks.

-Blogs: Blogging can be a great way for students to share their ideas, thoughts, and experiences with others.

Topic 1: How to come up with new ideas
1. There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes the best way is to just think about what you've seen or heard and then come up with something new. Other times, you may have to get creative. If you're stuck, check out these resources: http://www.thespruceeats.com/new-ideas-2769464
2. It's also important to be open to new ideas if you want to keep your creativity alive. The more you're willing to try, the better off you'll be. One way to do this is by accepting that there may not be anything that fits your idea perfectly right away. That's okay! You can always tweak it until it works for you and still keep the idea interesting.
