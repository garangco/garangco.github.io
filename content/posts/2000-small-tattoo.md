The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

History of Invention: How did inventors come up with new ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different places and times. Some of the earliest inventions were in the form of drugs and machines. Other inventions include firemen’s tools, clothing, carriages, and microscopes. There are even some inventions that have nothing to do with technology at all- like a piano that was used by Mozart. Inventions can come from anywhere, and they can help people in a lot of ways.
