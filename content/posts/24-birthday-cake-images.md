What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new, or changing something existing. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that it is "the act or process of converting a potential failure into a successful outcome." 
It can be seen as a way to improve the quality and efficiency of an organization's operations, as well as create new opportunities for business growth. 
The key to success in any innovation endeavor is ensuring that the innovation does not detract from the company's primary focus, which may be its core business.
