The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.
