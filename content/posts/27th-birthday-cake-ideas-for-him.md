Creative ideas: What to consider when creating them?
Creative ideas are a necessary part of any business or creative project. They can be used to improve your product, service, or idea. Here are some tips to consider when creating creative ideas:
1. What is your target market? When you’re thinking about creative ideas, it’s important to know what your target market is. Do you want to create an idea for a specific audience (like millennials), or do you want to create something that can be used by anyone?

2. Who will use your product or service? Once you know who your target market is, you need to consider who will actually use your product or service. It’s important that you have a good idea of how people use your product or service, so you can come up with unique ideas for it.

3. What are the benefits of my idea?
