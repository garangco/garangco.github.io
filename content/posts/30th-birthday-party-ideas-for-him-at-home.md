5th idea:
There are a lot of great ideas out there. But sometimes, it can be hard to come up with new ones. Here are five ways to get those creative juices flowing:
1. Take a walk: Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not even trying to think of them. So go for a walk, and let your mind wander.

2. Talk to people: Talk to friends, family, and strangers about their interests and passions. You never know what might spark an idea in your own mind.

3. Doodle: Don't worry about trying to draw something perfect or beautiful. Just let your pencil roam across the paper, and see what shapes and patterns emerge.

4. Play with toys: Toys are designed to stimulate creativity in children. So why not adults? Get out some LEGOs or coloring books and see what you can create.

Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.
