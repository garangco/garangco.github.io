Development of an invention: What steps do I need to take?
Invention ideas are something that can be created within a few hours or even less if you have some creativity and the right tools. To get started, you will need to come up with an idea for a product or service and then develop it further. There are a few key steps that you will need to take in order to create an invention:
1. Choose the right target market. This is where you will figure out what your product or service is meant for and who is the best target audience. You can do this by doing market research or by considering customer feedback.

2. Develop the idea thoroughly. Once you have determined your target market, it is time to develop your idea more fully. This includes coming up with a strong plan for marketing and selling your product or service.

Evaluation: What factors do you need to consider when evaluation your Ideas?
Creative ideas are a valuable component of any business. However, they can also be a challenge to evaluate and assess. There are many factors you need to consider when evaluating your creative ideas. 
One important factor is the quality of your idea. If your idea is low quality, it will likely not be accepted by potential customers or partners. You must also consider the feasibility of your idea- does it actually have a chance of happening? If not, you may need to rethink your pitch and make sure the idea has enough potential to overcome any challenges. Additionally, you should measure the impact of your idea- is it worth risking money and time just to bring it to life? Finally, you must determine whether or not people will actually use your idea- is it something that people would want in their business? If not, you may need to revise or remove its from consideration.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or ideas that differ from those currently in use. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve the quality of life for users, as well as innovation can help companies grow and succeed. There are many different types of innovation, but some common ones include:
1. New technology: This includes any new method or invention that improves on what has been used before. For example, a recent innovation is using drones to deliver food items to customers. This type of innovation has the potential to change how we consume and provide better service at a much lower cost than traditional methods.

2. Beating the competition: This refers to improving upon an existing product or service in order to bring about a competitive advantage over your opponents. For example, Apple Inc.
