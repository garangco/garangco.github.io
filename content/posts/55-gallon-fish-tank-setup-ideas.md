How to Use Ideas to Best Effect: What do you need to do in order to create ideas?
If you're looking to create ideas, the first step is to come up with some good ones. There are a number of different ways to go about it, but the most important thing is to be specific and locked down on what you want your ideas to accomplish. After all, if you don't have a clear plan for how you're going to achieve your goals, it's hard to get anywhere. Here are some tips on how to use ideas effectively: 1) Start by brainstorming them. This will helpyou come up with a broad idea of what could work as an idea, but also help you focus on specific possibilities.2) Take everything you've brainstormed and put it into a written list or plan. This will giveyou some idea of where your ideas might fit and what steps need to be taken in order for them to become a reality.

What Causes Innovation?
Innovation can be explained in a few ways. One way is to say that innovation comes from change. Another way to think about it is that innovation happens when something new and different comes along and helps someone or something do what they were supposed to do but didn't actually do it. 
One of the biggest reasons for innovation is often because someone needs a new product or service to solve a problem that they didn't previously have. Innovation also happens when people come up with new ways of doing things, or coming up with new ways to make things better.
