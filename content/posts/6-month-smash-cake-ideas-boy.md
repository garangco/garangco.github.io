The impact of creativity on art: How does creativity affect the artist?
Creativity is a vital force in the artist’s life. Without creativity, art would be little more than phantasy or dreams. It has been said that creativity is the ability to see things in a new light and to take risks. In order to be truly creative, an artist must have an outlet for their ideas and must be willing to experiment. Some artists rely solely on their own intuition, while others need help from others in order to get started. The impact of creativity on art is complex and difficult to study fully, but there are some general patterns that can be discerned. First and foremost, creativity often leads to innovation and change. This can lead to new ways of looking at old ideas or can result in the discovery of hitherto unknown aspects of the arts. Secondarily, creativity produces fresh perspectives on what has already been done.

The Psychology of Idea Generation
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that all people have in common. They all want to create something new and exciting, and they all feel like they can do it. This is where creativity comes into play. People are able to come up with ideas on their own, but often they need help coming up with the best ones. Here are four ways to get creative juices flowing:
1. Take on a smaller project: Sometimes the best way to get started with an idea is by taking on a smaller project that you can complete quickly and easily. This will help you get your head around the concept and start thinking about ways that you could improve it.

2. Draw on your experience: When you have some experience under your belt, it becomes easier to come up with powerful ideas.
