Implementation: How do you go about using new ideas to improve your business or organization?
When it comes to implementing new ideas, creativity is key. This is why businesses and organizations should take the time to brainstorm what they would like to accomplish with their new initiatives. After all, if a business does not have any clear goals or objectives, it will be difficult to put together a successful plan of action.
One way to come up with specific goals and objectives for your new initiative is by using a brainstorming tool. The most popular option for this is called Scrum, which stands for “Scenario Planning and Reworking in Construction”. This tool allows businesses and organizations to come up with specific goals that need to be accomplished in order for them to meet a certain deadline.

Another great way to come up with specific goals is by using SWOT analysis.

What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are everywhere. Whether it’s on a T-shirt, in your head, or on the internet, there are always new and innovative ways to approach problems and solve problems. 
There are many types of ideas, but here are three that stand out the most to me: 
1. The brainstorming method: This is a great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Simply take some time and brainstorm all of the different options until you have a few that you like the best.
2. The problem/solution process: This is another great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Once you have a few good ones, you can start working on solving the real world problems that they address.
