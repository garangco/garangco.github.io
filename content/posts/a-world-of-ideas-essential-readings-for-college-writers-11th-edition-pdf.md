Outlook: What do you think the future of technology holds for our industry?
As the world becomes increasingly connected, technology is changing the way businesses operate. Some of the biggest changes include the rise of online shopping and the increasing use of mobile devices. As this change takes place, many companies are looking to adapt their strategies in order to survive. 
One company that has been adapting quickly is Microsoft. The Redmond-based company has long been a leader in software and hardware development, but it's now focusing its efforts on developing “big ideas” that could have a significant impact on business. 

Microsoft has been working on a number of projects that could have a major impact on the future of technology. One project is called Project Apollo, which is focused on developing a new type of computer memory known as Accelerated Persistent Memory (APM).
