Invention as an event: What are some of the key steps in invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or idea. It can be something as simple as making a new recipe for cooking or designing a new shirt. The key to invention is coming up with an original concept that others can't come up with. There are many steps involved in coming up with a new product, but one of the most important is creating an idea.
