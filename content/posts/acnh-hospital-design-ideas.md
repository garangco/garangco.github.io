Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.

Conclusion: Tips for beekeeping and business success with brainstroming
Are you looking to be a successful beekeeper? If so, there are some key things you can do to help. One important thing to keep in mind is that brainstroming is one of the most successful business strategies around. Here are five tips for becoming a more successful beekeeper:

1. Take your time with each hive
Bees aren't constantly on the move, so it takes time to get their colonies up and running. Don't try to rush things - take your time and make sure everything is checked and balanced before starting hives again. This will help ensure that the colony is healthy and thriving.
2. Know your colonies' needs
When you're setting up your hive, it's important to know what the colony's needs are. Knowing what food they need, water requirements, space needed, etc.
