What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of doing things to new ways of looking at the world. While there are many creative ideas that can be explored, it is important to remember that creativity does not have to come from one person or even from a certain category of person. It can come from anyone who is curious and has the willingness to try something new.
