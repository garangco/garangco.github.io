What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design. Innovation is key to businesses and societies, both here in the United States and around the world. And while it can come from any form of creativity-from simple change to groundbreaking technology-invention has a special history and meaning in America.
It was on July 14, 1776, when Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence, which declared that each state was an independent nation with its own rights and destiny. Inventions dating back to ancient Greece and Rome had helped make these ideas a reality. But what made America unique? The answer lies in its history of innovation, not just as a country but also as a place where people from all walks of life could come together to share their ideas and dreams.

Innovation is at the heart of American identity.

What are some common ways to get started with ideas?
Ideas can come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: they're always ready to be used. Whether you're looking to start a new project, brainstorm for a new business idea, or just get your creative juices flowing, ideas are a essential part of any creative process. Here are five ways to get started with ideas: 
1. Take some time to think about what you want your business to be. This can be done by brainstorming different concepts or by taking a look at what others have done and figuring out how you could improve on it. 
2. Get organized. Once you've decided on the idea, it's time to start thinking about what kind of organization would work best for it. This can involve creating an outline or organizing everything by genre or need. 
3. Take some notes.
