Creativity and art are two very different things. One could say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while art is the creation of art. There are many examples of creativity in everyday life, from making a cake to painting a picture. However, it is interesting to explore what makes creativity so unique.
Different people have different opinions on what constitutes as creative art.
