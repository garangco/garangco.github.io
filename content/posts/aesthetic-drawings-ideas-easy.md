Conclusion
Concluding a brainstorming session can be just as important as starting one. Here are a few tips on how to effectively conclude a brainstorming session:
1. Thank everyone for their participation. This will help to foster a sense of team morale and keep people coming back to future sessions.

2. Summarize the main points that were discussed. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the goals of the session.

3. Choose one or two action items to focus on moving forward. This will help to keep the momentum going and ensure that progress is made on the goals that were set during the brainstorming session.

4. Assign someone to follow up on the action items. This will help to ensure that they get done in a timely manner and that everyone remains accountable for their part in achieving the goals.

Conclusion: What are the benefits of creativity in art?
Creativity has been shown to be a valuable trait in art, with many benefits for both the artist and the audience. Some of these benefits include:
1. Increased creativity and productivity – When artists are able to use their creativity to come up with new ideas, they are usually more productive overall. This can free up time for them to work on other projects, which can then lead to increased sales and better profits.

2. More interesting and engaging artwork – One of the biggest benefits of creativity is that it can help break down barriers between different disciplines and make art more engaging for both audiences. This can lead to more people becoming interested in watching or reading art, which can have a positive impact on financial success.

The Best Ideas: What are the best ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to get things started and can help you solve problems. Here are some of the best ideas on how to start working on your projects: 
1. Start with a blank slate: This is definitely one of the most popular ideas and can be used for both creative and everyday tasks. Create a list of ideas and then use them as a starting point for your next project. 
2. Take risks: When it comes to creativity, there’s no guarantee that everything will work out, but doing something new and risky can be a great way to get started. If something doesn’t work out, don’t be afraid to give up–you can always try again later. 
3. Collaborate: Collaborating with other people is another great way to get started on your projects.
