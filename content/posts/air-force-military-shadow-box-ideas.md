The Three Types of Idea: What they are and how to get them
Ideas can be defined in many ways, but the three most common ones are: a thought, an idea for a story, and a plan of action. All three have important roles in sales and marketing. Here are three tips on getting your ideas off the ground: 
The first step is to come up with an idea for something that you care about. What are some things you’re passionate about? This can give you ideas for stories, products or services that share your values or appeal to people who share those same passions. 
The second step is to come up with an idea for a story that will capture your readers’ attention. What will make this particular story stand out from all the others on the market? How do you want readers to feel after reading it? Are you targeting a specific audience or group of readers?

The Creative Process: How do you get started?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but the most successful creative projects always start with a few key premises. Sometimes these premises can be as simple as starting with an idea and working from there, or as complex as dreaming up an entire world full of new possibilities. Whatever the starting point, however, it’s important to keep things simple and focus on the task at hand. After all, creativity is about seeing things in a different light and coming up with new ways of seeing things.

Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make things better. From new ways to solve problems to coming up with unique ways of selling products, there are endless creative possibilities out there. Here are a few examples that might be of interest to you: 
1. A new way to use old materials – This is something that can often be creative and innovative. For example, some people create sculptures from old tires or cardboard. This not only uses the materials well but also creates an interesting final product. 
2. Using technology in a new way – Another great way to come up with creative ideas is to use technology in a different way than it usually is used. For example, some people create illuminated signs using lightbulbs implanted in the skin.
