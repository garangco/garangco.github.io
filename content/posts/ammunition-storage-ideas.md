Brainstorming: What is brainstorming?
The purpose of brainstorming is to come up with new and innovative ideas. However, many people confuse brainstorming with brainstorming exercises. The two are completely different activities.
In a brainstorm, you don’t actually come up with new ideas; you just share your thoughts and ideas with others. It can be a great way to get feedback on what you’re working on and to get feedback on how others might view your idea.

When using brainstorming exercises, however, it’s important to keep the focus on coming up with new and innovative ideas. These exercises help you develop your thinking skills, but they aren’t substitutes for actual creative problem-solving.
