Idea #3:
Ideas are the bedrock of any successful enterprise. Whether you're starting a business, developing a new product, or simply trying to solve a problem, having a great idea is the first step.
But what makes a great idea? And how can you come up with one? Here are three key tips:

1. Look for problems to solve. A great idea usually comes from solving a problem. So if you're looking for an idea, start by identifying problems that need solving. This could be something as simple as making your daily commute more efficient, or it could be something more complex like developing a new treatment for cancer.

2. Brainstorm with others. Sometimes the best ideas come from collaboration. If you're stuck, try brainstorming with friends, family, or colleagues.

How Invention Works: Invention can come from anything from a simple change in the way something works to creating a new product or technology.
Invention is the process of creating a new product or technology from something that already exists. It can come from a simple change in the way something works, or from creating a new market for an existing product. In both cases, innovation can mean big changes for both those who create it and society as a whole.
