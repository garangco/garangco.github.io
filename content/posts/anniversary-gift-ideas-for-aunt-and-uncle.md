There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music.
There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music. While there are many great artists out there who specialize in one type of creative art, it is important to have an understanding of what the different types of creativity can do for an artist. For example, if you’re a painter and you want to create pieces featuring color and light, then you might use sculpture as your medium. However, if you’re a sculptor and you want to create pieces that are dark and moody, then you might use painting as your medium. The point is that there is no one right way to do creative art - it all depends on the artist's preferences and what they're interested in doing.

How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.
