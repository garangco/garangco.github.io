What are some ideas?
There are so many things to think about when it comes to ideas. Some of the most common are what to do, how to do it, and who to do it with. Here are a few ideas for you: 
-Start with a plan: What are your goals for this project? What should you focus on first? What obstacles should you overcome first? This will help you create a blueprint for the project that others can follow. 
-Work together: When starting a project, it’s important that everyone is on the same page. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and try to do everything yourself. Get someone else involved who can help make sure the project goes smoothly. 
-Think outside the box: There are always new ways to solve problems that haven’t been considered before.

What is the inventor’s story?
Invention Ideas are the stuff of legends and myths. What lies beneath their surface? For some, Invention Ideas may be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that revolutionizes how people live. However, for others, Invention Ideas may be something much more complex and amazing. These ideas come from within the mind of the inventor- often a creative thinker who has dreamed up a new idea for years but never had the opportunity to turn it into a reality. Inventors have an amazing story to tell and it often starts with one question: What if?
