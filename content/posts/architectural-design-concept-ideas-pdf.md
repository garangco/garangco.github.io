Innovation processes: How does an inventor go from idea to product?
Invention processes can vary significantly depending on the inventor's background and experience. Generally, an inventor will need to generate a number of different ideas in order to come up with a product that is new and exciting. This might include generating concepts for products, working on prototypes, or even coming up with new business models.
One important factor that will affect the invention process is the inventor's willingness to risk failure. If the inventor feels that their idea is too risky or if they do not believe that it can be turned into a successful product, they will likely not go ahead with it. In addition, the inventor's skills and knowledge might also be needed in order to create a successful product.

Big ideas are the heart of any startup. These are ideas that could have a significant impact on the company and its customers, but might not yet be realized. Startups often come up with big ideas during their early years, when they are still formulating their business plan and trying to figure out how to make their idea work. Once they have a better understanding of what they’re doing, startups often start developing more detailed plans for how to execute their big ideas.
