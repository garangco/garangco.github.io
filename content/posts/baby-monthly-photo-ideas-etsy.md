Why it's important to have a growth plan
It's important to have a growth plan because it sets expectations for the future and helps you stay on track. By knowing what you want, and how to get there, you can create an achievable plan that will help your business grow. Here are three key ideas to help build your growth plan: 
1. Know your industry and where you fit in. Knowing where your business is in the market and what competition is doing will help you determine what needs to be done next in order for your business to stay afloat.

The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

Conclusion: Why should we care about invention?
Invention is the creative process of coming up with a new idea or design. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. The invention of the printing press was an incredible event in human history, and it is also responsible for many medical advances. There are countless other examples that can be provided, but the point is that invention is important.
There are several reasons why innovation should be taken seriously. First, innovation allows companies and countries to come up with new products and technologies faster than they would otherwise be able to. Second, it helps businesses make money by creating new ideas and products that people will want to buy. Third, innovation can help scientists learn more about how the world works and how to better understand problems. Finally, innovation can help society function more efficiently â€“ for example, by developing new ways of warfare or managing social networks.
