Invention ideas are a common part of everyday life, but they can be quite extraordinary. Some inventions are so small and simple that they might not even be considered invention, but they have the potential to change the way we live and work. One such invention is the electric toothbrush, which was first invented by a man named Samuel Morse in 1814. It has since been used to clean teeth and remove plaque from teeth, and it has even been used in bariatric surgery.
