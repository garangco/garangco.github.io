What are the new ideas?
The new ideas in health care are based on the concept of patient-centricity, which is the idea that patients should always be the focus of the healthcare system. This shift away from traditional hospital-based care to apatient-led model would result in a reduction in costs and better patient outcomes. Another proposal is to adopt more outpatient services, such as walk-ins and telehealth. Other new ideas include using AI to help doctors rule out potential treatments and using data analytics to diagnose and treat diseases.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.

A brief history of the patent system: What is it?
The patent system, also known as the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent system, is a system of intellectual property rights that allows businesses to protect their discoveries and innovations by awarding exclusive rights to those who make them. The patent system was first instituted in 1790, when the US Congress passed the Patent Act. The patent system has been amended multiple times over the years, but its fundamental structure remains unchanged. The USPTO administers a number of different types of patents, including utility patents, design patents, industrial design patents, and trade secrets.
