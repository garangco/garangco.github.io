What is customer service and how do you provide it?
Customer service is a term that is often used interchangeably with customer relations. It refers to the various methods through which customers can interact with companies and receive the service they need. From calling in for a repair to speaking with a supervisor, there are many ways to get help from your company.
There are two main types of customer service: face-to-face and online. Face-to-face customer service allows customers to interact with employees directly. Online customer service is more common, but it can also be accessed from computers or devices. This type of customer service provides a variety of options for customers, including webinars, chat rooms, and social media platforms.

Both types of customer service have their own strengths and weaknesses.

Business models: How do inventors develop their ideas?
Invention ideas are not always easy to come by, but they can be very valuable. They can help businesses of all sizes create new products or services that might not have been possible before. If you're thinking of coming up with an invention, it's important to think about how you would go about doing it. There are many different business models that inventors can develop their ideas in, and each one has its own unique advantages and disadvantages.
One popular business model for inventor development is the Prototyping Method. This approach involves creating a model of a product or service that will allow for feedback and modification until it is ready to be released to the public. This allows inventors to test their ideas before they even release them to the public, which can help them immensely in terms of refining their concepts and getting more feedback from potential customers.

What is invention?
Invention is an act or process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Invention has come from many different places, including science, business and creativity. Today, invention is used more often in technology than it ever has been before. 
Invention can be something as simple as making a new product or service or taking an idea and turning it into a reality. Sometimes invention comes from the simplest things- like coming up with a better way to chop wood. Other times, it takes longer but is more complex- like coming up with a new way to print money or create new ways to store information. 

But whatever the case, when someone comes up with an innovative solution, that’s something special. It shows they have think outside the box and are willing to try somethingnew just to see if it works.
