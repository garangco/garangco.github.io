Definition of innovation: How does it differ from previous generations?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is different from what has been done before. It can be classified into two main categories, incremental and revolutionary. Incremental innovation occurs in areas such as technology, business, and marketing; while revolutionary innovation occurs in areas such as science, medicine, and the environment. 
The definition of innovation has changing over time, but two main aspects have remained consistent: it should be creative, and it should be new to the market. Innovations should also be feasible to implement quickly and cost-effective. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have a clear understanding of how innovation works and how to define it narrowly or expansively according to their needs.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas are a powerful way to get started on any project. They can help you see a solution to a problem or come up with new ideas for something. There are many benefits to having ideas, including getting inspired and finding new ways to approach your work. Here are five of the most common: 
1. Ideas can help you think outside the box. When you have new ideas, you can start to see other possibilities for what could be done. This can free up your mind and allow you to come up with better solutions than you would have thought possible. 

2. Ideas can help you get organized. Having lots of different ideas makes it easier to organize them all into a one big idea category. This is especially helpful if your idea is complex or difficult to execute without assistance. 

3. Ideas can help you find solutions to problems.
