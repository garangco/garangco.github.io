The value of creativity: What it is, how it can be used, and why it matters
Creativity is a important factor in any organization or enterprise. From product development and marketing to business strategy and communications, creativity is needed on all levels. There are many reasons why creativity can be so valuable, and one of the most important is that it can help solve problems.
One of the simplest ways to increase creativity is by providing an environment where people can express themselves freely. In an environment where creativity is encouraged, people are more likely to come up with ideas that may not have been thought of before. This can lead to new solutions being proposed, or even new products or services being created.

Another reason why creativity is so valuable is because it can be used to solve problems. When something feels impossible or difficult, often times creative minds are able to come up with solutions that seem impossible at first glance.

The future of education: What will be the biggest changes in education in 2022?
The future of education is shrouded in many potential changes. One of the most important changes will be the way we educate our students. In 2022, there are many ideas that could impact education in a major way. Some of these ideas include: 
1) Increased emphasis on video gaming and physical activity to improve learning: Video gaming has become increasingly popular in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. This can help children learn more quickly and efficiently, as they can get lost in the game and not have to worry about homework or other school tasks. Physical activity also has great effects on learning. Children who spend more time active have better mental health, better grades, and less anxiety. 

2) Changes to how schools are run: Many schools are currently run like businesses.
