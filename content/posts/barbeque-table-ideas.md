How to invent something: Share tips on how to come up with new ideas.
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, process or service. It’s a key part of innovation and economic growth. To be successful, you need to have a good idea and the drive to see it through.
So how do you come up with new ideas? There are a few methods you can try:

1. Brainstorming: This is a great way to generate ideas with a group. Get together with some friends or colleagues and just start throwing out ideas. The more outrageous the better – you can always tone it down later. The point is to get the creative juices flowing and come up with as many ideas as possible.

2. Research: Sometimes the best ideas come from understanding what already exists and finding ways to improve upon it.

Small ideas can be very powerful, but when they're spread out thinly they're vulnerable to being killed by other ideas. That's where big ideas come in. By coming up with a large, overarching idea, you can fill in the gaps between the small ideas and create a more coherent plan. Big ideas are often more interesting, innovative, and exciting than smaller ones and can help your business take off.
