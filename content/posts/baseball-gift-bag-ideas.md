The benefits of brainstorming
Brainstorming is a great way to generate new ideas, and can be done either alone or in a group. When brainstorming, it is important to suspend judgment and allow all ideas to be considered. This can help prevent ‚Äúgroupthink‚Äù, where people only consider ideas that are similar to what they already know. Brainstorming can also help people come up with creative solutions to problems.
There are many different ways to brainstorm, but one popular method is called ‚Äúbrainstorming by free association‚Äù. This involves coming up with words or phrases that are related to the topic at hand, and then using those words or phrases to generate new ideas. Another method is called ‚Äúbrainstorming by analogy‚Äù, which involves thinking of similar situations or problems and how they were solved.
