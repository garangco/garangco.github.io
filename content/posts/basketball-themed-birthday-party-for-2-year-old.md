Conclusion: Why should businesses invest in innovation?
Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve and stay competitive. Innovation can be found in anything from technology to marketing. However, businesses that are Continuously Innovation-Minded will see a return on investment (ROI) much sooner than those that aren’t.

This requires significant resources and time, but with the right attitude and strategies, businesses can reap the rewards of innovation sooner rather than later.
