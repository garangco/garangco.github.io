How to make your home more comfortable
If you're looking for ways to make your home more comfortable, there are a variety of ways to go about it. Here are a few tips to get the most out of your comfort zone: 
1. Try adding a couch or bed in the living room. This will give you space to relax and watch TV, while improving your visibility and calming atmosphere. 
2. Add some plants or stuffed animals to help improve your mood and circulation. 
3. Get a fan in the bedroom so that you can cool off when you're not using the bathroom or bedroom. 
4. Install an air conditioner in winter if you can't find one outside or add window AC if that's an option for you. 
5. Get a recliner or rocker for relaxation in the living room or bedroom instead of just sitting on the floor all day long!

Creative artists: How many there are and what makes them special?
Creative artists are an often overlooked but important part of the art world. They come from many different backgrounds and have a range of different skills and techniques. Some are able to use their creative abilities to create beautiful or powerful artwork, while others specialize in specific genres or styles. However, all artists have something special that sets them apart from other artists. Here are four examples: 
Allison Bechdel is a well-known cartoonist who specializes in creation of humorous strips about female characters, which has made her one of the most recognizable and popular comic book authors of all time; performance artist Grant Wood created memorable posters and paintings during the Depression era that stand as benchmarks for American artistry; and David Stone Martin is known for his dramatic story-telling with his unique use of sound and light.
