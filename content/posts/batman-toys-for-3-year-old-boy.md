ideas for inventions
If you're looking for invention ideas, you've come to the right place. Here are a few ideas to get you started.
For the health-conscious, how about a vegetable juicer that also makes nut milk? Or a water bottle that filters out impurities and tracks how much water you're drinking each day?

For the home cook, how about a smart oven that can be controlled from your smartphone? Or a dishwasher that also sterilizes baby bottles and offers an eco-friendly option for washing dishes?

For the busy professional, how about a mobile office that allows you to work from anywhere? Or a personal assistant that responds to your voice commands and can schedule your appointments and remind you of deadlines?
