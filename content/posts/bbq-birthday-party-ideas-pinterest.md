What is the young adult book industry like today?
The young adult book industry is changing rapidly, and there are a number of different ways that it is doing so. One way that the industry is changing is in terms of how books are being published. 
Before, books were published as e-books and mailed to customers. This method allowed for less editing and revision, which made the books more straightforward to read. However, this type of publishing has been gradually replaced by the electronic book format. 

The electronic book format allows for a much wider range of content to be included in a book, making it more diverse and vibrant than ever before. Additionally, this format eliminates the need for physical copies of books, which makes them more cost-effective. 

As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see what new ways it comes up with to keep readers engaged and invested in its products.
