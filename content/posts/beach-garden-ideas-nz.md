How innovation effects businesses: It can lead to new products, services, or processes that make a company more competitive and successful.
Innovation has been a key driver of business success for centuries. For most businesses, innovation is about creating new products, services, or processes that make a company more competitive and successful. However, innovation can also lead to changes in how a company does its work that can have significant impacts on its competitive position and overall performance.
For example, imagine you are a business that sells products made from natural materials. As the world becomes increasingly polluted and health hazards increase, your products may not be enough to meet the needs of your customers. To stay competitive, you may need to find new ways to produce and sell your products using more sustainable materials.

Similarly, when it comes to research and development (R&D), businesses often face stiff competition from rivals who are better equipped to conduct innovative research and develop new products quickly.

What is big ideas?
What is big ideas? Big ideas are the seeds of creativity that can change the course of history. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common- they are big enough to generate a response from the average person. Here are some tips on how to get started with big ideas: 
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you understand its potential and potential danger. 
2. Look for examples of what has worked before. This will give you a sense for what other people have done that has helped them achieve their goals. 
3. Ask yourself a question: What if? What would it be like if this were to happen? This will help you determine whether or not your idea is really worth pursuing.
