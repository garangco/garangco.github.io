Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.

Conclusion: the importance of invention
Invention is the key to progress. It is the engine of change. It drives economies and creates new industries.
Invention is important because it leads to progress. Progress is defined as a forward or onward movement toward a destination. It is the opposite of regression, or a return to a previous state. In order for there to be progress, there must be invention. Invention leads to progress by creating new products, processes, or services that are more efficient than the existing ones. This increased efficiency can lead to improved quality of life for individuals and societies as a whole.

Invention is also important because it drives economies. Economies are systems of production and exchange that provide people with the means to support themselves and their families. They are powered by human labor, which in turn is driven by motivation and ideas. Ideas come from invention.
