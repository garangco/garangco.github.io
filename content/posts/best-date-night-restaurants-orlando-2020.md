Creativity as a craft: How can it be used in your life?
Creativity is a craft that can be used in many ways in life. Whether it’s coming up with new ideas for products or services, or simply coming up with new ways to approach problems, creativity is an essential tool for anyone. For example, if you’re a graphic designer, creativity can be used to come up with new designs for advertisements or even just the basic design for a website. On the other hand, if you’re a musician, creativity can be used to come up with new songs or concepts for albums. In any case, creativity is something that should always be taken advantage of and used in any way possible.
