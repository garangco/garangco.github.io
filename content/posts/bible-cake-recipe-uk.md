The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.

Filming: How do you film your creative ideas?
Filming Creative Ideas can be a pretty enlightening experience, if done correctly. Not only do you get to see your ideas in action, but you also get to learn how to capture and film creative moments that will help you grow as a filmmaker. Here are four tips to filming creative ideas: 1. Do your research: before you start shooting, it’s important to do your research on what type of footage is going to work best for your story. What does the audience want? What are the challenges of capturing that vision successfully? These questions will help determine the filming techniques that work best for your project. 2. Get creative: not all creativity is created equal. Sometimes, filming creative ideas can be more about experimenting than taking risks.
