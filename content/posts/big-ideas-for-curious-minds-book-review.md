The history of brainstorming
In the late 1940s, a group of psychologists working at Yale University began to study what is now known as brainstorming. The team, led by George Prince, was interested in finding out whether people could come up with more ideas if they worked on their own or in groups.
The psychologists conducted a series of experiments in which participants were asked to come up with as many ideas as possible for different topics. They found that people who worked on their own came up with fewer ideas than those who worked in groups.

The psychologists also found that the quality of the ideas generated was better when people worked in groups. This is because people are able to build on each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas as a result.

The findings of the Yale study sparked a lot of interest in the idea of brainstorming and its potential benefits.

Ideas for New Products: What new products are being created that could be appealing to people?
New products are being created all the time that could be appealing to people, such as new transportation options, wellness advancements, and more. It is hard to come up with a specific idea for a new product, but here are some possibilities: 1. A bike-sharing service that would allow people to use bikes to get around town instead of having to take public transportation. This could be especially helpful for those who live in complexes or have difficult access to public transportation. 2. A weight loss supplement that was made specifically for women and would help them lose weight and reduce their risk of heart disease. 3. An aromatherapy inhaler that could be used for general health benefits or for aromatherapy applications such as treating stress and anxiety.

Additionally, having a team of experts who can help with the development and implementation of an idea can make it easier to get the message out there and grow awareness around it.
