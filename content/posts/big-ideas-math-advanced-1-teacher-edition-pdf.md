How creativity impacts our lives
Creativity is a key factor that impacts our lives in many ways. Some say it’s the spark of inspiration that gets us going, while others say creativity comes from the willingness to take chances and work hard. Whatever the case may be, creativity has an impact on our lives in some way. 
For example, if you have a creative idea for a new product, you may be more likely to produce it if you are inspired by the prospect of making something new and different. Likewise, if you find yourself constantly searching for ways to improve your current work or business, then creativity may be one of your biggest assets. After all, it is through risk and experimentation that we learn how to create great things.
