I was born in 1984, and I'm now a Sophomore at Stanford University in California. My parents were both Scientists. My father is a Scientist and my mother is a Engineer. I always loved Science because it was the only thing that was constant in my life. When I was younger, I would watch molecule-by-molecule movies and take detailed notes on what everything looked like. This led to me wanting to become a Scientist myself one day.

What is innovation and why do we need it?
Innovation is the ability to come up with new ways of doing things. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation is important because it gives businesses and individuals the chance to try something and see if it works or not.
There are a few different types of innovation: scientific, technological, economic, social and cultural. Scientific innovation occurs when scientists come up with new ways to study the world around them and improve our understanding of it. Technical innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make products or services more efficient or effective. Economic innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make money by selling their products or services. Social innovation happens when people come up with ideas for different organizations or societies that could benefit from them.
