The different ways in which creativity can be used in art: To create atmosphere, mood, or story
There are numerous ways in which creativity can be used in art, from creating atmosphere to mood to story. Here are four examples:
1. Atmosphere: by adding a sense of calm or excitement, an artist can create a believable and distracting environment for the viewer to inhabit.
2. Mood: by using different colors and brushstrokes, an artist can create a range of emotions that can be manipulated through composition and color alone.
3. Storytelling: by weaving together disparate elements into one story or plot, an artist can create engaging and dimensional work that becomes both memorable and unforgettable.

Brainstorming methods
There are a variety of ways to brainstorm invention ideas. One method is to think about problems you encounter in your daily life and try to come up with solutions. Another approach is to look at existing products and think about how they could be improved. You can also brainstorm with a group of people, which can help generate more ideas. Whichever method you choose, the goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible so that you can eventually find the best solution.
