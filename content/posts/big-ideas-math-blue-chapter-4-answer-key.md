What are the benefits of big ideas?
There are many benefits to big ideas, including increased creativity, innovation, and productivity. However, there are also a few key considerations that should be taken into account when creating big ideas. Here are four tips to help you create better big ideas:
1. Be clear and concise: The more information you can provide in a clear and concise manner, the easier it will be for others to understand your concept and develop a plan for implementing it.

2. Be realistic: Always be honest with your expectations and goals when developing big ideas. Don’t try to “solve everything” – instead focus on areas that can be quickly improved or neglected.

3. Get input from others: When developing your big idea, always consult with others in order to get their feedback and thoughts on the idea before moving forward.

What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.
