They can be something as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or a new way to do something you’ve always done but didn’t think of before. The important thing is that the idea has to be something that you can see yourself doing in the future, and that you can imagine living your life with. Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 
1. Don’t force yourself to come up with ideas; let your mind wander. There are no right or wrong answers, just some helpful things to keep in mind when brainstorming: What do you want? What does this have potential to achieve? What would make this an interesting and useful addition to your product or service? How can you make it more efficiently or effectively?

What are the best ways to create ideas?
Ideas are hard to come by, but they're worth taking the time to get. If you can find them, you can use them to help your business or project succeed. Here are five ways to think up ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with other people: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be tough to pick just one. But Brainstorm with other people and see what they have in mind. This will help you come up with a better idea than if you were all alone. 
2. Take some time for yourself: Not everyone is meant to be running their own business. Sometimes it's good to take some time for yourself and do something that's really challenging but also really fun. This will help you come up with new ideas that may not have been previously thought of.
