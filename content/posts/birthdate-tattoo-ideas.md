Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods and technologies?
Innovation is a process of creating an new product, service or technology that is different from what has been done before. Innovation can bedefined as any change that makes something better or more efficient. Innovation can also bedefined as the ability to bring new ideas to market quickly and create value for customers. 
Traditional methods and technologies can also be called innovative, but they are not always the best options for how things are done. For example, a company might use a traditional way of doing marketing to get their product into people’s hands sooner, but this approach might not be the best option when it comes to creating value for customers.

Overcoming Barriers to Innovation
Innovation is essential for businesses to survive and thrive in today’s ever-changing landscape. However, many organizations struggle with innovation because of various barriers. By understanding and overcoming these common obstacles, companies can create a culture of innovation that drives success.
One major barrier to innovation is fear of failure. Employees may be hesitant to suggest new ideas or take risks because they don’t want to be seen as failures. To overcome this, organizations need to create an environment where it’s okay to fail. This can be done by Encouraging employees to experiment and think outside the box, Celebrating small successes, and Learning from failures.

Another barrier is lack of resources. Many companies believe that they need a large budget in order to innovate, but this isn’t the case.
