Let's take a look at some new ideas that could help improve our lives.
There are a lot of new ideas out there that could help improve our lives. Some of the most interesting and innovative ones include: using technology to improve communication, combining mindfulness with exercise to reduce stress, and using smart technology to automate tasks that can be more relaxing. Here are a few examples: 
1. Using technology to better communicate: through apps or websites, we can now connect with others more easily than ever before. This could be especially helpful if we have trouble getting along with others or feel stressed out about our daily routine. For example, a way to connect with your friends could be by talking on the phone or sending text messages while you work on something else. 
2. Combining mindfulness with exercise: both physical activity and mental practice can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.

How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.
