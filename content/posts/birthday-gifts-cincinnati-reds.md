Memory exercise: How can we improve our memory and concentration?
Memory is an important skill that we can use to improve our concentration and memory. Here are some ways to improve our memory:
1. Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods help to create a strong immune system and keep our brains healthy.

2. Get enough exercise. Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function and mental clarity.

3. Use brain teasers or mental puzzles to keep your mind active and engaged. Brain teasing tasks include things like finding the pattern in a jumble of numbers, solving complex math problems, or making decision trees.

4. Practice gratitude every day for all the good in our lives. Gratitude can boost mood, focus, and creativity; it can also help us remember positive experiences from past times.

Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. However, when it comes to invention research, there are key steps that must be followed in order to find potential products or services that could be used in business. 
One important step in finding inventions is understanding the target market. This means knowing what customers want and how they would use a new product or service. Additionally, it is important to understand the technology behind the product or service in order to create an idea for potential customers. 

Once an idea has been created, it is important to find someone who can test and market the product. This person can help identify any potential consumer problems and potentially create marketing materials that could be helpful in building sales.

What are some new ideas?
A recent report on the future of technology suggests that a number of new ideas are emerging for improving ways to connect people and create opportunities. One such idea is the use of robots to help with tasks that traditional humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as packaging goods, loading onto a truck, or cleaning. Another is the development of artificial intelligence (AI)powered assistants that can assist people with their day-to-day tasks, from booking appointments to grocery shopping. While these ideas may seem like small tweaks to existing workflows, they could have large implications for businesses and society as a whole.
