Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

Conclusion: Are there any drawbacks to having ideas? How can you overcome them?
Ideas are a great way to think about new ideas and come up with new ways to do things. However, there are some drawbacks that can occur when having ideas. The first drawback is that it can be difficult to come up with all of the details needed for an idea to take off. This can lead to a lack of confidence in your idea and a less likely chance of seeing it through to the end. Another drawback is that ideas can be very time-consuming and require a lot of effort from you and others involved in the project. This can lead to feeling overworked or undervalued when it comes time for the idea to actually be implemented.
