The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.

Security and defense: Will technological advancements lead to more widespread warfare or new security solutions?
With the rapid growth of technology, there are many potential uses for it in security and defense. However, these same advancements could also lead to more widespread warfare if not used responsibly. For example, new autonomous vehicles could be used in place of soldiers on battlefields, potentially leading to more fatalities or injuries. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) could be used in lieu of human beings in order to analyze security footage or provide recommendations for deterrence. However, these advancements should be used with caution and only when appropriate, as they could lead to further civilian casualties and displacement.
