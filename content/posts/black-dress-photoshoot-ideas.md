The challenges of reaching our goals: How can we overcome roadblocks?
There are many challenges we face when looking to achieve our goals, but overcoming them is key to success. Here are a few examples:
First and foremost, it is important to have realistic expectations. If we set ourselves unrealistic goals, we will be less likely to achieve them. We should also be honest with ourselves about what we want and what our limitations are. This will help us identify any roadblocks that may stand in our way.

The second challenge is breaking the habit of procrastination. This can be difficult as it is an acquired taste, but having a regular plan and sticking to it will help us stay on track. However, if we don’t have enough motivation or if the situation feels too hard, it can be tough to keep going.

Thirdly, it is important to be consistent with our efforts.

brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.

How to overcome creative blocks
If you're feeling stuck creatively, don't despair. There are a number of things you can do to overcome creative blocks and get your ideas flowing again.
One helpful approach is to brainstorm with someone else. This can give you some fresh perspectives on the problem you're trying to solve.

Another tactic is to take a break from whatever you're working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is some time away from the project to see it in a new light and have that breakthrough idea.

And if all else fails, there's always the tried-and-true method of just sitting down and forcing yourself to start writing or painting or whatever it is you're struggling with. The hardest part is usually getting started, but once you get going, the ideas will start flowing again.
