Brainstorming: How do you gather inspiration for your work?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach? Are you trying to inspire people to do something or just get some new ideas off your mind? Next, think about the problem youâ€™re trying to solve: is it something thatâ€™s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future? Once you have an idea for a problem, itâ€™s time to start coming up with ways to solve it. Finally, think about how you might approach solving the problem. Do you have any specific examples of how this has worked out before? If not, what kind of inspiration do you need?

Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods and technologies?
Innovation is a process of creating an new product, service or technology that is different from what has been done before. Innovation can bedefined as any change that makes something better or more efficient. Innovation can also bedefined as the ability to bring new ideas to market quickly and create value for customers. 
Traditional methods and technologies can also be called innovative, but they are not always the best options for how things are done. For example, a company might use a traditional way of doing marketing to get their product into peopleâ€™s hands sooner, but this approach might not be the best option when it comes to creating value for customers.
