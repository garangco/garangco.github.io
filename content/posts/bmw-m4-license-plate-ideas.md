What inspired the inventor to invent their particular invention?
Inventors often have a specific idea in mind when they come up with their invention. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Sometimes, an inventor's idea is just too good to ignore. That's what happened to Northrop Grumman Aeronautics company founder Robert Northrop. He came up with the design for the first jet engine in the 1920s, but it wasn't until he patented it that he got his name recognition and fortune.
