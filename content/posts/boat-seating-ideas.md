What are big ideas?
Big ideas are what get people thinking and sparking new ideas. By definition, big ideas are those that are difficult or impossible to imagine, but which offer a great potential for solving a problem. They can come from anywhere, in any field, and can range from the small to the large. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A new way to make money: This could be anything from starting a small business to developing a new technology.

2. A better way to care for your health: This could include things like finding a way to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins or developing more effective medical treatments.

3. A new way of transportation: This could include anything from building an electric vehicle to creating a flying car.
