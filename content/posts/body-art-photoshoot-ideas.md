Patenting an invention: What is the process?
Patenting an invention can be a complex process, but there are key steps that are typically followed. Inventors typically create a patent application, which is then submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The USPTO will review the application and decide whether to issue a patent or not. If the USPTO decides to issue a patent, the inventor must then file a full U.S. Patent Act lawsuit against someone who has already registered their trade mark or copyrighted their invention.

Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.
