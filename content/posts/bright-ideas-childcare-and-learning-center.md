How do you come up with big ideas?
How do you come up with big ideas? There are a few methods that can be used to come up with big ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when you come up with a list of ideas and then try to come up with the best one. Another method is by doing mockups or prototypes, which are simulations of what an idea could look like. Finally, there’s coming up with solutions to problems, which can be anything from developing a new product to creating a new way of doing business. All of these methods can help you come up with some great ideas, but it all starts with having the right mindset and setting goals.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy. Whether it's a new idea for a product or service, or an innovative way of thinking about your work, creativity is essential to any business. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a walk on the wild side: When it comes to creative ideas, there's nothing quite like spending time out on the open range. Find an abandoned quarry or animal pen for inspiration, and see what kind of new designs come into being as a result. 
2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.
