Creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative processes can vary in their specifics, but all involve the creative process of coming up with ideas, narrowing them down to a few that work well, and then implementing those ideas into a tangible form. Here are three examples of creative processes: 
1. Brainstorming: brainstorming is when people come up with new ideas without any specific constraints. This can be done in private or in group settings, and it's often used to come up with new ways to do something or improve on an existing product. 
2. Design: design is when a product or idea is created from scratch. It starts with the idea and then goes through various stages, including development, testing, and production. 
3. Programming: programming is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem or comes up with a new way to do something.

The Aftermath of Creativity: What happens to creativity after it’s completed?
Creativity is a natural and essential part of many people s lives. It can be used to create new ideas, or to explore old ones. But what happens to creativity once it s completed?
There are a few factors that can affect the quality of creativity after it s complete. The first is whether or not the creative person has received enough feedback. If they haven t, they may not have been able to improve their ideas or come up with new ways to approach problems. The second factor is the intensity of the creative process itself. If it s gentle, nurturing, and doesn t require any hard work or effort on the part of the creator, then they may be more likely to maintain their creative Passions for life. But if the creative process is strenuous and demanding, then they may not be as inspired again as soon as they once were.
