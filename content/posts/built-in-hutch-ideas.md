what is innovation?
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It can be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that solves a problem. Innovation is what allows us to progress as a society and make our lives better.
Without innovation, we would still be living in caves and eating raw meat. Innovation is what led to the creation of fire, which allowed us to cook food and stay warm. Innovation is also what led to the invention of the wheel, which made transportation much easier.

Innovation is not just about creating new things, but also about improving upon existing ideas. For example, the first cars were very crude and unreliable. But over time, through innovation, they became more reliable and efficient.

Innovation is essential for businesses to grow and compete in today’s global economy.

How Invention ranges from ancient to modern
Invention has been around for centuries, with some of the earliest examples dating back to ancient Greece. Inventions that have shaped the modern world include the telephone, car, and air conditioning – all of which were created in the 19th century. However, some inventions are much older than that and predate even humanity. For example, the wheel was first invented by a man named Pangloss in 4500 BC.
