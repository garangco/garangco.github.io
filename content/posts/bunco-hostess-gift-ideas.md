Thatâ€™s what happened to a man named Nikola Tesla. Tesla is best known for his work on alternating current (AC) electricity, which has revolutionized how we power our homes and businesses. His latest invention, the Tesla coil, could make AC even more powerful and efficient.

The Differences between Creative Art and Reality Art: There are a few different types of creative art, but they all have one common goal â€“ to inspire.
Creative art is all about inspiring people to think differently. Reality art, on the other hand, is all about reality. They may have different goals, but they both aim to promote an accurate representation of the world around them. Here are some key differences between creative and reality art: 
1) Creative artists often use their own imagination to create pieces that are unique and inspiring. Reality artists often rely on real-world objects or events to create their work. 
2) Creative artists often use more color and light than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on shadows and reflections for their work. 
3) Creative artists often use more movement than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on stills and images to create their pieces.

Invention Benefits Society
Inventions have been a part of society for centuries. From the humble tools that farmers and peasants used to build their homes, to the technology that allows us to fly, today's inventions benefit society in many ways. 
Some of the most notable inventions include the printing press, which allowed for a greater variety of voices to be heard and ideas to be explored, as well as vaccinations and antibiotics. Others include automatic cars, home air conditioning systems and even 3-D printing. 
The benefits of inventions are vast and range from improving our quality of life to saving lives. With so many innovations on the horizon, it is important that society continues to support these advancements by investing in research and development opportunities.
