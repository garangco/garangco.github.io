How do you get started with ideas?
Start with a brainstorm. A brainstorm is a process of generating new ideas. It can be used to come up with concepts, products, services, or anything you want to think about. Sometimes you need just a few ideas to get started, and others times you need many different ones to come up with something great. The best way to find out if you need more than one idea is to do some brainstorming yourself.
