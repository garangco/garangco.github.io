The ultimate goal of big ideas is to create a better future. But how do we achieve it? Some key ingredients include creativity, collaboration, and a willingness to learn. These three elements are essential for any idea to become a big idea, and they can be easily applied in business and governance alike. By leveraging these three elements, businesses can foster innovation and unleash the potential of their employees. For governments, this means fostering an environment that encourages critical thinking and open debate. Big ideas can also lead to new technologies and new ways of doing things.

How to have more ideas
The ability to have more ideas is a key skill for any entrepreneur or business person. However, not all ideas are equal and some may be better than others. To find the best ideas, it’s important to assess how well they align with your goals and objectives. Here are three tips on how to have more ideas:
1. Assessment: Without giving your idea too much thought, it’s natural to want to rush into anything without first assessing its potential risks and benefits. The first step in assessing an idea is to understand its key benefits and how they could impact your business or product. Once you know these things, you can determine if the idea has potential for success.

2. Evaluation: Evaluating an idea requires taking the time to figure out what it could do for your business and what challenges you may face along the way.
