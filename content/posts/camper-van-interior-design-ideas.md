Definition of innovation: Innovation is the process of making something new and better.
Innovation is the process of making something new and better, whether it's a product, service or idea. Innovation is essential for businesses to remain competitive and successful, as it helps them improve their products and services while keeping up with the latest trends.
There are a few key ingredients that must be in place for innovation to work: creativity, determination and a willingness to take risks. However, these three qualities can also be difficult to muster at times. For businesses that want to see innovation take hold, they need to focus on each individual ingredient in order to create an environment where creativity can thrive and risk-taking is encouraged.

The power of creativity: how does creativity work?
Creativity is an intricate and often mysterious process that goes beyond the simple act of creating. It involves a deep understanding of the creative process, as well as the individual’s own personality and environment. This understanding can be gained through years of practice or by simply thinking about creativity in new ways.
There are many theories about creativity, but one that has been dominant for many years is the Creative Art Theory. This theory suggests that creativity comes from a combination of two things: the artist’s own ideas and the environment they are working in. The artist creates what they see and hear in their surroundings, then uses this information to create their own masterpiece. The environment also plays a role in creativity, by providing ideas and inspiration to the artist. When these two elements combine, it leads to a unique piece of art that can be enjoyed by anyone who visits it.
