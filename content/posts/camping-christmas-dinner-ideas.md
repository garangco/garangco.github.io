The history of innovation:
I. Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think and create. II. Inventions and creativity have always been important in human life, but their importance has increased in the past century because of the technological advances made by humans. III. Technology has helped make many innovations possible, including the development of new transportation systems, communication systems, food delivery systems, and more.IV. However, some inventions and creativity may not be practical or profitable – for example, Roomba being shelved after only a few years on the market due to its high cost. V.
