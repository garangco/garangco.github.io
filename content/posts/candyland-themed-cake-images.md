What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways to cook, Tate Modern’s newest art gallery or a new way of travelling. Here are some of our favourites:
1. A creative way to relax: take a walk in nature. This can involve finding a meadow with plenty of trees, sitting under a tree and taking in the natural sounds.

2. Experiment with different food preferences: try out different recipes or eat something that you’ve never tried before. This will open your eyes to what foods you like and how they taste.

3. Get creative with your time: use up time by doing something creative like painting, drawing or sculpting. This will help you de-stress and get lost in thought for a little bit.

2020: How do we make sure that our 2020 election is fair?
In 2020, the United States will face another harsh election season. Key issues that will be debated include how to make sure that the election is fair and what measures can be taken to prevent fraud. Here are four ideas for making sure that the 2020 election is fair: 
1. Create a public database of all registered electors in order to help ensure accuracy and transparency. This would help reduce voter fraud and make it easier for voters to check whether their ballot has been cast correctly. 
2. Increase the number of voting machines from precincts to whole neighborhoods so that more people can vote in one voting place rather than scattered throughout various precincts. This would improve security and ensure that all ballots are counted accurately. 
3. Make it easier for citizens with disabilities to vote by offering identification requirements or waiving residency requirements in certain cases.

The benefits of brainstorming.
When it comes to problem-solving, brainstorming is key. By coming up with as many ideas as possible, you increase the chances of finding the best solution. Brainstorming also allows you to think creatively and come up with ideas that you may not have otherwise thought of.
In addition to being a great problem-solving tool, brainstorming can also help improve your team’s communication and collaboration skills. By working together to come up with ideas, team members can learn to better communicate with one another and understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses.

So next time you’re faced with a problem, don’t hesitate to gather your team together for a brainstorming session. You may just find the perfect solution – and have a lot of fun in the process!
