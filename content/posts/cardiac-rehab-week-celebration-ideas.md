Brainstroming is a process of rapidly focusing on one’s surroundings in order to solve a problem. The brain is able to do this because it has two different types of cells, which are called gray and white cells. Gray cells focus on what they see in front of them, while white cells focus on the past and future. Brainstroming is a great way to think fast and solve problems.

What are some common mistakes people make when starting a blog?
There are a few common mistakes people make when starting a blog, and the most important thing is to be aware of them so that you don’t make them. Here are some mistakes to watch out for:
1. Not knowing what you want your blog to say. When you first set up your blog, it might seem like a great idea to just post whatever is on your mind. But if you don’t really know what you want your blog to achieve, then it will likely fail. So start by planning out what your goals are and focus on hitting those goals rather than just posting anything without knowing why or how it will help you achieve those goals.

2. Not having a clear strategy for growth. One of the best ways to ensure that your blog does well is to have a solid strategy for growing it over time.

Definition of creativity: What is needed to be creative?
Creativity is a term that has been used for centuries to describe different aspects of life. In the modern world, creativity is often described as the ability to come up with new ideas or concepts. It can be used in different ways, but generally it refers to the act of coming up with something new. There are many definitions of creativity, but one that is most commonly used is the definition given by Julius Caesar: Creatio est ad astrae bonum.

How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.
