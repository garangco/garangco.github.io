How can you come up with big ideas?
Big ideas are important when it comes to coming up with new ideas, but they can also be a challenge. There are a few things you can do to help come up with big ideas that will be successful.

Finally, make sure your idea is feasible. This means that it should not be too much trouble for people to implement your idea, and it should not require too much money or time.
