Progress monitoring: How can we track our progress and see how much more we can do?
Progress monitoring has always been a critical part of any project. However, as the world becomes more and more complex, it is even more important to keep track of what we are doing and how far we've come. This can be done through tools like project management software or a progress tracker app. Here are some big ideas for progress monitoring:

2. Use a progress tracker app: Progress tracking apps help us keep track of our progress on a daily or weekly basis. This way, we can see whether we are on track to reach our goals or not.
