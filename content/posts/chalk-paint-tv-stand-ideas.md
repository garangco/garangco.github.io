5) Use natural light to boost productivity
Light is one of the most important things in a person's life. It can help you focus, read, and do your work better. There are many ways to use natural light to boost productivity. Here are 5 tips:
1) Get a window that opens up onto natural light. This will allow you to get plenty of exposure to the sun.
2) Use sunlight exposure clocks to time your work periods so you can work more effectively in the morning and at night.
3) Make use of windows with high-quality blinds or curtains that block out all light. This will keep you productive while working in darkness.
4) Use a desk lamp rather than traditional office lights. This will allow you to see what you're working on more clearly and avoid eyestrain.
5) Work in bright or bright daylight whenever possible.

Tips for Building a Better Home: How can you go about doing this?
One way to improve your home is by taking on some DIY projects. There are a variety of ways to go about this, so it really comes down to what you're interested in and what's available to you. Here are some tips for improving your home: 
2) Check out home improvement stores before starting any project. Not all stores carry the same tools and supplies, so you'll need to do some research before beginning any project. Look for stores that specialize in particular types of repairs or enhancements, like ad-hoc woodworking or electrical work. 
3) Get a good localpenter if you can't find the supplies or know someone who can help you out. A good localpenter will be able to help with everything from fixing dents in walls to installing new flooring or window trimming.
