How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

Ideas are a powerful tool for problem solving, and they can be used in many ways. Some ideas are provisional, which means they are not fully formed and may not work as planned. Other ideas may be creative, which means they are new and have no precedent. But the most common kind of idea is the provisional, which is used to come up with a solution to a problem.

The Importance of Commercializing Your Invention
Invention ideas are the lifeblood of the modern economy. They are the source of all new products and services, and they drive economic growth. Without them, we would be stuck in a world of old, outdated products and technologies.
So why is it so important to commercialize your invention idea? There are several reasons:

1. To make money: Obviously, this is the main reason why people commercialize their invention ideas. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, you can make a lot of money by bringing it to market.

2. To change the world: Invention ideas have the potential to change the world for the better. By commercializing your idea, you can bring your vision to reality and make a positive impact on society.
