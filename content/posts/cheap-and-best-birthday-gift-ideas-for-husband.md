The five types of creativity: Abstract, Imaginative, Creative, Mental, and Physical.
Creative ideas are a type of creativity that comes from different areas of the brain. The five types of creativity are abstract, imaginative, creative, mental, and physical. Abstract creativity is when an idea is without any specific details. Imagination is when an idea comes from your mind and not from reality. Creative ideas come from all different parts of the brain and can be physical or mental. Mental creativity is when you have a strong idea but do not know how to put it into words. Physical creativity comes when you come up with new ways to use old things. Finally, there is creative physicality which comes about when you create something that no one has ever thought of before.

gap between theory and practice in innovation: Innovation always involves a change in perspective
The gap between theory and practice in innovation can often be a major obstacle to successful innovation. This problem is compounded by the fact that different fields of study have different methodologyologies and approaches to innovation. This lack of consistency is often the cause of failure when it comes to new product conception or business models. To break through this barrier, researchers typically adopt a methodological perspective, which takes into account the current state of knowledge in their field. In addition, practitioners need to adopt an innovative mindset, which means constantly seeking new ways to improve old products and services. The two sides of the innovation equation need to come together for a better understanding of how the product should be designed, what kind of customer service should be offered, and how much impact new ideas will have on older ones.

What to do with ideas: From brainstorming to taking them to market
Ideas are like stars in a sky. They can bring light to a dark room or help you turn a negative into a positive. However, like most things in life, they come with baggage. Sometimes the baggage is good, and other times it’s bad. Here are four tips for dealing with ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas 
No one ever has all the answers to every question or problem. “Open your mind” and let new ideas flow in. Even if they don’t work out, that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from them. 
2. Take the time to study what worked before 
Studying what others have done can help you develop your own idea without feeling bound by former solutions or failures.
