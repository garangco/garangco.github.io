History of innovation: How has it been used and abused in the past?
The history of innovation is filled with examples of it being used and abused. In the past, innovation has been used to improve efficiency, increase production, decrease costs, and create new products. However, these same advantages can also be abused if not Properly managed.

Innovation can be abused when it is used for unoriginal or unwanted purposes. For example, in the early 1900srialist countries like Russia used innovation to produce innovative Catherine the Great cars while developing other technologies behind the scenes which led to their rise to power. By doing this, they were able to stay afloat during a time where other countries were struggling. However, this practice resulted in Russian technology becoming outdated and eventually lost its competitive edge. 

Similarly, in China during the late 1990s there was a large focus on artificial intelligence (AI) as part of efforts to modernize their economy.

Conclusion
Creative Art: The End of an Era?
For years, creative art has been a staple in society. Whether it’s paintings in a museum or music playing on the radio, art is everywhere. However, with the rise of technology and the changing landscape of the world, is creative art becoming a thing of the past?

With more and more people living their lives online, it’s no surprise that the demand for creative art is declining. With so much content available at our fingertips, it’s easy to see why many people are losing interest in buying paintings or going to concerts. With less demand, there’s also less money going into funding creative projects, which means we could see a decline in quality and quantity of art in the future.

That’s not to say that all hope is lost for creative art.
