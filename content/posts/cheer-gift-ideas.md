The consequences of having big ideas?
Many people believe that having big ideas is essential to creativity and innovation. However, the consequences of having big ideas can be very costly and time-consuming.

Additionally, it can be difficult to find backers for big projects and even harder to get the word out about them. When a company has a large idea, it can often become overshadowed by other more pressing challenges.

In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network.
