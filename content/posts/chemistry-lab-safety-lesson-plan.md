Taking Action: How do you take action when you have creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new products to a better way to do things. When you have creative ideas, it can be hard to know what to do with them. Here are three tips for taking action on your ideas:
1. Research your idea thoroughly before starting anything. This will help you understand the feasibility of the idea and whether or not it is something that is possible or even desirable.

2. Make a prototype of your idea. This will give you a rough idea of how your product or service will look and feel. You can then test this out on customers or see if there is enough demand for the idea to actually start manufacturing it.

3. Take action! Once you have some prototypes and data, it’s time to take action!
