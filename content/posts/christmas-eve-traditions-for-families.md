Why do we need innovation?
Innovation is key to sustaining economic growth and ensuring that society can meet the needs of its citizens. Innovation has been touted as a way to improve efficiency and productivity, reduce costs, create new products or services, and secure new markets. But what are the benefits of innovation specifically? And how do we get there?
There are a number of reasons why innovation is so important. First, it allows businesses to experiment with new methods and concepts, which can lead to increased efficiency and innovation.
