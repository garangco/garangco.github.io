Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.

The process of innovation
Innovation is the process of introducing something new into the market. This can be a new product, a new service, or a new way of doing things. Innovation is often driven by necessity, as companies look for ways to improve their products and services to meet the needs of their customers.
Innovation starts with an idea. This can come from anywhere – from within the company, from customers, or from outside sources. Once an idea has been identified, it must be developed and tested to see if it is feasible and will meet the needs of the target market. If it is successful, it will be launched into the market and become available to consumers.

Innovation is not easy, and it often takes many tries before a successful product or service is developed.
