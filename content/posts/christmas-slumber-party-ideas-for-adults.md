The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.

The power of creative ideas: How can they help your business or organization achieve success?
Creative ideas can help your business or organization achieve success in a variety of ways. By using creative ideas, you can increase the chances of success and create a more positive working environment. Here are six tips to help you find creative ideas that may be beneficial for your business or organization:
1. Allow yourself time to brainstorm. When you have an idea for a product or service, don’t immediately start creating prototypes. Give yourself time to think about it and come up with different options. This will help you get a better understanding of what the product or service can be and how it could be improved.

2. Talk to other businesses. Not all businesses are the same, so talking to other businesses will give you a better idea of what they’re doing and how they’ve been successful with their products or services.
