Trends in technology: How is technology changing?
Technology is constantly evolving, and with it, the way we live and work. In 2020, there are many ideas for how technology will change in the next year. Here are a few examples: 
- digitize everything: physical things will be digitized to the point where they can be stored and accessed from any device. This could include everything from your phone to your books. 
- AI will take over jobs: machines are starting to become smarter than people and can now do most tasks on their own. This could lead to layoffs in the workforce as companies adopt AI strategies to save money. 
- Virtual Reality will take over: our reality will be turned into a virtual one, allowing us to experience different worlds without ever leaving our home. This could have a number of implications, such as making travel more comfortable or increasing creativity.
