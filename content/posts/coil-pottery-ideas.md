What is brainstroming and what does it do?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of focusing and suspending judgment in order to analyze or understand complex information. Brainstroming can be helpful when trying to solve a problem, understand information, or make decisions. It can also be beneficial during intense debates or discussions. However, there are a few potential drawbacks to brainstroming that should be considered. First, brainstroming can lead to distractions and fatigue. Additionally, it can also lead to inaccuracy and bias in analysis. Finally, brainstroming can be difficult to keep up with and may not be effective in all cases.
