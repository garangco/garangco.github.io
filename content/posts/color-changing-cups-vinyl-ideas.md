The future of business depends on how social media affects the way businesses operate. This is evident in the way that online communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, have created an individualized society where people are more interconnected than ever before. With this connectivity comes a need for companies to manage their social media accounts in order to remain relevant and popular. Additionally, businesses must be mindful of the ways in which social media can be used to infringe on privacy rights and mislead customers.
