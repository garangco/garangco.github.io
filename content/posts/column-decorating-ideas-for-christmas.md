The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.
