Definition of Innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods?
There are a few key distinctions between innovation and traditional methods when it comes to how it is defined. Innovation typically refers to new or different ways of doing something, while traditional methods usually refer to older, more common ways of doing things. Some other key differences include that innovation often involves trying different things out and seeing what works, while traditional methods often rely on certainties and expectations which can often lead to disappointment. Despite these differences, however, both types of innovation can have important implications for businesses and society as a whole.

Concluding thoughts on big ideas.
In recent years, big ideas have come to the forefront of many people's minds. Some of these innovative concepts are new and exciting, while others are more general in nature but still important in terms of advancing humanity. In this article, we will take a look at two key ideas that have received a lot of attention in recent years- artificial intelligence and digital citizenship. 
Artificial intelligence is one big idea that has been receiving a lot of attention recently. Many experts believe that this technology can be used to create intelligent machines that can do a majority of the work for us- from cleaning and grocery shopping to driving and making decisions on things like politics and industry. If this technology does become reality, it would be huge news, as it would mean that we could no longer rely on humans to make most decisions for the world.
