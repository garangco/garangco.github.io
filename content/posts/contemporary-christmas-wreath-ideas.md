Creativity in the arts: Some key aspects to consider.
Creativity in the arts goes beyond the creation of artworks or sculptures. It can also be found in the use of ideas and concepts, as well as working with others to create something beautiful. Whether it’s a hobby or a profession, creativity is important to have at any stage of life. Here are some key aspects to consider when trying to achieve creativity: 
1) Be open-minded: One of the most important things to remember when trying to be creative is that no two things are ever alike. As such, you must be willing to try new things and explore different fields of thought. However, don’t forget that creativity comes from within – so if you can remain patient and allow your thoughts and ideas to grow, you will eventually find an avocado on the grocery store shelf that matches your design inspiration!
