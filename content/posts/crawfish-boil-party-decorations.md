coming up with new ways to do things: How can businesses come up with new ideas that work?
Businesses have been coming up with new ideas for years, but it can be hard to pinned down what works and what doesn't. Here are three tips to help you come up with new ideas: 
1. Try different methods of marketing: This might seem like a common-sense tip, but often times the best way to find a new customer is to try something different. Go beyond just traditional methods like advertising and social media promotion. 

2. Be open to change: When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes the best way to find out if something is working is to give it a try and see what happens. 

3. Be persistent: It takes some effort – even stubbornness – to come up with new ideas that work.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.

Conclusion: How does brainstorming work? How do you come up with great ideas? What makes good ones? Is there a difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions?
In any business, brainstorming is a process that often helps to come up with great ideas. It can be used as part of an overall strategy or as a standalone tool. The most important thing is to find the right way to use it and to make sure it’s effective. There are two main types of brainstorming: formal and informal. Formal brainstorming typically takes place in a group setting and is focused on coming up with specific solutions to problems. In contrast, informal brainstorming can take place in your own time and can be more creative. It can involve anything from talking about your ideas with friends to simply coming up with your thoughts on the matter at hand. While there’s no one way to do brainstorming, using both forms will help you come up with more innovative ways to solve problems and come up with better ideas.
