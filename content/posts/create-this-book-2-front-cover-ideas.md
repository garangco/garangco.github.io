Patent Ideas: How do you get your invention patentized?
Patent ideas are a valuable tool for businesses. They can help you protect your invention, and make sure that your idea is protected by law. However, getting your invention patentized can be a challenge. There are a few ways to get your idea patented, and it depends on the specifics of your invention. Here are four tips to help you get started: 
1. Do your research: When you come up with an idea, it's important to do your research. You need to know what kind of protection you want, how long it'll take to get it approved, and what other risks there may be associated with getting the patentized version of your idea out there. 

2. Get in touch with the right people: Once you've come up with an idea, it's important to get in touch with the right people.

Definition of big ideas: What is it that you want your company to achieve?
When it comes to big ideas, there is no one right answer. Some companies achieve their goals by focusing on a few key areas while others have a more holistic approach. What matters most is that your company has initiatives that are meaningful and impactful. Definitions of big ideas can vary, but all should include at least one important factor: The potential for success. 
If you’re not sure what it means to have a big idea, ask yourself this question: How will your company benefit from developing this initiative? Once you know the answer, you can start brainstorming ways your business can use the product or service to achieve its goals.

Results and Feedback: How does your project turn out?
I’m about to head out on a camping trip with my family, and I wanted to know what type of tents and sleeping bags are the best for the trip. I found a few different options, but couldn’t decide which one would be best for us. After some research, I came up with this list of the best tents and sleeping bags for camping trips:
1) national Geographic Hexagon Sleeping Bag - This bag is perfect if you're looking for a comfortable and spacious tent. It has an interior profile that makes it easy to find a place to sleep while on your trip. Plus, it comes in black or green!

2) Osprey Tents - These tents are perfect if you're looking for a heavyweight tent that can withstand any weather conditions. They come in both children's and adult sizes and have plenty of hanging space inside.
