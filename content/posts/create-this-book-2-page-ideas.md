The different types of creative art
Creative art is a process of creating something new and original. There are many different types of creative art, each with their own unique process and results. Some of the most popular types of creative art include painting, sculpture, photography, and architecture.
Painting is one of the oldest and most popular forms of creative art. It involves using a brush to apply paint to a surface, often canvas or paper. Painting can be done in a variety of styles, from abstract to realistic.

Sculpture is another popular form of creative art. It involves creating three-dimensional objects from materials like clay, stone, or metal. Sculpture can be either functional or purely decorative.

Photography is a type of creative art that captures images using a camera. Photography can be used to capture memories, tell stories, or document events.
