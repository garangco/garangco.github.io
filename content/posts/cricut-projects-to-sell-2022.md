Definition of a big idea:
Big ideas are those that are so big and complex that they take up a lot of space in a piece, but are actually very easy to understand and implement. Some big ideas may be things like global warming, energy independence, or creating a more perfect society. Regardless of the complexity of the idea, it should be easy to understand why it is important and what could happen if it were implemented.

What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.

Tips for creating unique and interesting blog posts: How can you make your posts stand out from the rest?
Creating interesting and unique blog posts is a key part of any online writer’s repertoire. There are a number of ways to go about this, but one way that can really set your blog apart from the rest is by using creative writing techniques. Here are some tips for trying out these techniques:
1. Start with a strong opener. Your first sentence should be intriguing and introduce your readers to the topic at hand.

2. Use verbs tense in your writing to make your words feel more alive. This will help keep your reader engaged and motivated to read on.

3. Think outside the box when it comes to plot points and ideas. Not all blog posts need an obvious solution, and instead, you can use them as a jumping off point for new storylines or characters for your blog post.
