Topic 1: How to come up with new ideas
1. There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes the best way is to just think about what you've seen or heard and then come up with something new. Other times, you may have to get creative. If you're stuck, check out these resources: http://www.thespruceeats.com/new-ideas-2769464
2. It's also important to be open to new ideas if you want to keep your creativity alive. The more you're willing to try, the better off you'll be. One way to do this is by accepting that there may not be anything that fits your idea perfectly right away. That's okay! You can always tweak it until it works for you and still keep the idea interesting.

Basic Home improvement projects: How to do them
When it comes to home improvement, there are many ways to do things. One way is to take a basic approach and do some projects yourself. This can save you time and money, as well as make your home look nicer in the process. Here are six basic home improvement projects to get you started:
1) Repair or replace broken windows: This is a simple project that can be done on your own. All you need is a screwdriver, some nails, and a drill. Once the windows have been fixed, all that remains is to paint them if desired.

2) Install a new heater: If your current heater isn’t performing as it should, it’s time to replace it. There are many models and brands available, so go with one that meets your needs. Installation will take only a few minutes once you have the tools needed.
