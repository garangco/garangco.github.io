Tips for post formatting and design:
1. Start by thinking about what you want your article to say. What topics do you want to cover? How do you want people to feel after reading it? Do you want it to be a tutorial, an overview, or a comprehensive guide?
2. Choose the right style for your article. There are many different ways to write an article, and there is no one style that is best for all situations. You can use a simple, straight-forward layout or you can go for something more experimental and stylish.

3. Use formatting features wisely. When writing articles, always use grammar and punctuation correctly. This will help readers understand your piece and stay on target throughout the entire process.

4. Avoid using clichés and other easy-to-spot errors.

Invention Displays: How can you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of protecting your invention from others who may want to make use of it. There are several ways to do this, but one of the most common is through filing a patent application. Patent applications can take many months to complete, so it’s important to be prepared for the wait. There are also several requirements that must be met in order to file a patent application, including having an idea for an invention and being able to prove that your idea is original. If you have any trouble filing a patent application or if it takes longer than expected, don’t worry – there are plenty of resources available to help you out.
