How do you choose the right idea to pursue?
There are a lot of choices to make when it comes to what ideas to pursue. It can be hard to know which one is the right one, especially if you don’t have any experience or knowledge about the topic. Here are some tips to help you choose the right idea: 
1. Start with something you’re passionate about: This is always a good option, because it will give you more energy and motivation to keep going.
