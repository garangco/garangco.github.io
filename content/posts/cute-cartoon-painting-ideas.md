What obstacles do they present?
A new approach to energy storage is being developed with the goal of overcoming some of the major obstacles to its widespread implementation. One obstacle is the need for large, expensive batteries that can be used in stationary or home applications. Another obstacle is the difficulty in fabricating lithium-ion cells that can withstand repeated charges and discharge cycles. However, a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University has created a new battery design that overcome both challenges and could soon be available for use in devices such as cell phones and electric vehicles. The new battery uses nickel-cadmium (NMC) cells instead of lithium ion cells to store energy, which makes it more environmentally friendly and cheaper to produce. The team's findings are published in an upcoming issue of Science Advances.

Brainstorming: What is brainstorming?
The purpose of brainstorming is to come up with new and innovative ideas. However, many people confuse brainstorming with brainstorming exercises. The two are completely different activities.
In a brainstorm, you donâ€™t actually come up with new ideas; you just share your thoughts and ideas with others. It can be a great way to get feedback on what youâ€™re working on and to get feedback on how others might view your idea.

When using brainstorming exercises, however, itâ€™s important to keep the focus on coming up with new and innovative ideas. These exercises help you develop your thinking skills, but they arenâ€™t substitutes for actual creative problem-solving.
