Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

Creative process: How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that can be broken down into three main parts: Ideation, Execution, and Delivery. Ideation is the process of coming up with ideas or solutions to problems. Execution is the task of putting these ideas into action and making them a reality. Delivery is the final step in the creative process, which includes making sure that the ideas are implemented and realized properly.

Creative ways to improve your work
Creative ideas can improve the quality of your work, whether it be for creative writing, graphic design, or even marketing. Here are a few tips to get you started:
1. Try different methods and styles when creating your work.

If you’re stuck on something specific, take a break and try another approach. Experiment with new graphics or types of text as well. This will help you develop new ideas and see which ones work best for your story or project.

2. Be open to feedback and extra criticism.

When it comes to your work, don’t be afraid to ask for help from others. Feedback is key in learning how to improve further and make the most of your creativity. It will also help you focus on the right things while working on your project.
