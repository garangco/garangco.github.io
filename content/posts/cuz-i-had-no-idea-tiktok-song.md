Creativity and art are two very different things. One could say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while art is the creation of art. There are many examples of creativity in everyday life, from making a cake to painting a picture. However, it is interesting to explore what makes creativity so unique.
Different people have different opinions on what constitutes as creative art.

Whether or not you believe in this definition entirely depends on who you ask. What we can do though is provide someamples of creativity that have been influential in our lives.
