What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come in many forms, but they all share one common goal: to make something new and interesting. Whether it’s coming up with a new way to do something or coming up with a different perspective on an old favorite, creativity is the Key to Success. Here are some creative ideas that may help you get started on your creative endeavors: 
1. Come up with a new idea for a product or service. This could be anything from creating a unique design to coming up with a new concept for an existing product.

2. Take on an existing challenge. Whether it’s finding a different way to do something or reaching out to someone who has already done it, challenging yourself can lead to creativity and change.

3. Ask yourself what you want your business to be remembered for?

History of Invention: How did inventions come about?
Invention comes about when a person or group of people come up with a new idea for something and then try to make it a reality. Some inventions, like the printing press and the Internet, were actually born out of necessity- like during World War II when people needed to create documents quickly. Other inventions, like the telephone and the electric chair, were made because someone was just curious or had an amazing idea and didn't want to give up that idea. There are so many different types of inventions, it's hard to choose just one as the history of invention is pretty amazing!

Why should someone take a big idea and turn it into a reality?
There are a few reasons why an idea can become something real. Maybe it's because it has the potential to solve a problem people have been dealing with for years, or maybe it's got the potential to change the way people live their lives. Whatever the reason, turning an idea into reality is something that can be difficult but definitely worth doing. Here are three tips on how to make your big idea a reality: 1) think long and hard about what you want your business to achieve, 2) do your research before starting your business, and 3) stay focused on what you want your business to be and not on what others are expecting it to be.
