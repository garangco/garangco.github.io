Brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a variety of techniques that can be used in order to generate new ideas. One popular technique is known as brainwriting, which involves writing down ideas on paper or in a digital document. This can be done individually or in a group setting.
Another common brainstorming technique is known as mind mapping. This involves creating a visual representation of ideas, often using colors and images. This can help to stimulate the creative part of the brain and can be used to organize thoughts in a more logical manner.

Lastly, brainstorming can also be done through problem-solving techniques such as SCAMPER. This acronym stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange.

Overcoming Writer's Block: What to do when you can't seem to come up with anything.
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. Here are a few ideas to help you overcome writer's block and start getting your thoughts down on paper.
First, take a break. Sometimes when you've been staring at a blank page for too long, your brain just needs a break. Get up and walk around, do something else for a little while, and then come back to your writing with fresh eyes.

Second, try brainstorming. Get a piece of paper and write down whatever comes to mind, no matter how silly or unrelated it may seem. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and figuring out which ones you want to explore further in your writing.

Third, ask yourself some questions. What are you trying to say with your writing? What are you hoping to accomplish?
