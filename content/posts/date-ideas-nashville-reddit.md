How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.

Definition of big ideas: What are some examples?
Big ideas are ideas that have the potential to change the world. They are often large and ambitious, but they can be implemented easily and quickly. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income: This idea would give everyone a fixed amount of money every month without any strings attached. It would help to lift people out of poverty and into a higher paying job.

2. A gender-neutral pronoun: This could be a huge political and social shift, as it would redefine what it means to be human. Additionally, it would help to break down many gender-based stereotypes.

3. A digital divide: This is a term that refers to the fact that many people in developed countries have more access to technology than those in developing countries. The digital divide has contributed to many social problems, such as inequality and poverty.
