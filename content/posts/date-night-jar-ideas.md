Conclusion
After spending hours brainstorming and developing your invention idea, it's finally time to reach a conclusion. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you wrap up your project:
1. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. If you can't articulate the problem, you won't be able to sell your invention idea to others.

2. Do your research! Inventors who are well-informed about their industry and their competition are more likely to be successful. Make sure you know what's already out there and what needs improvement.

3. Have realistic expectations for your invention idea. It's important to be confident in your idea, but remember that not every great idea will become a multimillion-dollar business. Be prepared for bumps in the road and set reasonable goals for yourself and your team.

What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of change that occurs in any business or organization. Innovation can be defined as the ability to create new and better ways to do something. Innovation can also include the addition of new ideas, products, services, or even business models. Every business has room for growth and innovation if done correctly. However, there are some steps businesses must take in order to achieve success with innovation.
One important step in achieving success with innovation is understanding your customers. You need to understand what they want and how you can provide it to them. Once you know this, you can begin developing innovative ideas that will help your customers achieve their goals.

Another step businesses must take is creating a positive customer feedback loop.
