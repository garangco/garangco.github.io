New technologies that could lead to more affordable housing are being developed, such as blockchain technology. This technology can be used to create a digital ledger of housing transactions, which would make it easier for people to find and buy a place.

Aftermath: How does innovation impact people and businesses?
Innovation has a profound impact on people and businesses. By bringing new ideas to market, innovation drives change that can improve the quality of life for everyone. But what happens when innovation is used to unfairly advantaged those who have money or power? This is where the aftermath comes in. After innovation becomes a tool for advantage, it can lead to backlash against those who have been disadvantaged by it- usually those who have no say in how it’s used.
