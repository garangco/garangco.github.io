When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first.

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.
