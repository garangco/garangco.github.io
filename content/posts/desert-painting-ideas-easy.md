Why do you think your ideas are interesting?
Ideas are the fuel that drives creativity. They can be used to come up with new ideas, or to develop an existing idea into something better. There are a few things you need to do in order to make your ideas stand out from the rest:
1. Make sure your ideas are well-conceptualized and engaging. This means having a clear idea of what you want your product or service to do, and making sure it is interesting enough for people to want to try it.

2. Be clear about what your target audience is. If your idea is for a new product, make sure you know who your target market is, and how you plan on reaching them. This will help you focus on the right things when developing your pitch.

3. Use effective marketing techniques to market your idea.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.
