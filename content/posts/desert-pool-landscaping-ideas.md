The creative process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come from a variety of places within the individual. They can come from inspirations, ideas stemming from one's own life experiences, or even just things that strike the individual as fun or interesting. 
There are a few key things that go into creating creative ideas. The first is to have some sort of starting point. This can be anything from an idea for a project to inspiration for your next painting or poem.
