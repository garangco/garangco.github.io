This would be a monthly payment to every citizen that is free of charge, regardless of their income. This would help to encourage people to work and improve the economy. Additionally, there are many other potential ideas that could be implemented into society if given enough time and thought.

What is big ideas?
What is big ideas? Big ideas are the seeds of creativity that can change the course of history. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common- they are big enough to generate a response from the average person. Here are some tips on how to get started with big ideas: 
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you understand its potential and potential danger. 
2. Look for examples of what has worked before. This will give you a sense for what other people have done that has helped them achieve their goals. 
3. Ask yourself a question: What if? What would it be like if this were to happen? This will help you determine whether or not your idea is really worth pursuing.

They can help us come up with new ways to approach problems or solve them, and they can also inspire us to create new ideas of our own. Ideas can be valuable when they are used wisely, but they can also be dangerous if not taken advantage of.

A recent study found that people who are brainstroming are more creative and innovative than those who are not. This is because when people are brainstroming, they are thinking about one specific problem or idea and coming up with new ways to solve it. This allows them to be more creative in their thinking process and generate new ideas.
