Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers. For example, Google created Street View in order to allow people to see how their cities look from close up. This type of innovation is often used for education and marketing purposes. Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers. For example, Apple Watch was developed as a way for people to keep track of their time and step-by-step exercises without having to carry a phone around. This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.
