Ideas that work: Why do some ideas work and others don't?
Creative ideas are often the most successful, but it can be tough to know why. Here are four reasons:
1. You have to be willing to try something.
2. What you think is working may not be working for others, so you have to come up with a new idea that does what they want and works for you.
3. Your idea might not be original, but it's more likely to work because it's been tried before or because someone else has already created a similar product or service that people are using and liking.
4. Your idea might be better than what's currently out there, so give your stuff a go and see whether it works or not â€“ even if it doesn't quite fit the mold of what everyoneelse is doing!

The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.
