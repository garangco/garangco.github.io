How do we become involved in the invention process?
Invention is a process where people come up with new ideas for products or services. It can be difficult to come up with new ideas, but there are many ways to get involved in the process. There are several ways to become involved in the invention process, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
One way to become involved in the invention process is to attend an inventor's mixer. An inventor's mixer allows people to share their ideas with other inventors and potential customers. It can also help people develop their ideas more effectively.

Another way to become involved in the invention process is by working on a project with another person. When you are working with someone else, you have a better chance of developing your idea together and making it a reality. This is important because it can help you learn about other people's concepts and how they would approach solving a problem.

What makes good ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any creative team. They provide the spark that ignites new ideas and inspires others to come up with their own. Without good ideas, your team may lack the energy or motivation to continue working on a project. It's important to be able to come up with great ideas, even if they're not easy to execute. Here are six tips to help you get started: 1) Be open-minded: No one is perfect and every idea is different. When you're evaluating an idea, don't be afraid to give it some time and test it out before committing yourself fully. 2) Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem difficult or unappreciated. Keep at it until you've cracked the code for creating great ideas.
