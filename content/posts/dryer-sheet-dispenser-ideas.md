Creative writing:
Creative writing is a process of coming up with new and unique ideas for stories and novels. It can be quite fun to come up with new plots, characters, and settings, and to see what different people think of your work. However, it can also be difficult to make your ideas come alive in a way that makes them interesting and engaging reading experience. Here are some tips on how to get started in creative writing: 
1. Make sure you have a clear vision for your story. Once you have an idea for what you want your story to be, it’s important to make sure that the story fits within that vision. If you don’t have a solid plan for how your story will play out, it may end up becoming something that’s far from interesting or engaging reading experience. 

2. Be patient.
