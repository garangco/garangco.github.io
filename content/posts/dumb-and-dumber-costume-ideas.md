Changes in the job market: 2019 predictions for the US economy
The job market continues to grow, with new jobs being created at a steady clip. But the future of the economy is still uncertain, as there are several possible trends that could affect the job market in the next few years. 
One trend that could have an impact on the job market is a rise in automation. This technology is slowly changing the way businesses operate, and as it does, many jobs will become obsolete or difficult to fill. As automation takes hold, many people may have to move into new positions, which could lead to increased unemployment rates. 

Another potential trend that could affect the job market in the next few years is a rise in wages. This increase may be due to factors such as better economic conditions and rising productivity levels. However, it can also happen as a result of negotiations between companies and unions over wages.

Types of innovation:
Innovation is the process of producing a new product, service, or idea that uses existing technology. Innovation can come from a variety of sources, such as creativity, innovation, and risk-taking. 
One of the most common types of innovation is using technology to improve the quality of life for people. For example, Apple has developed technologies that make it easier for people to communicate with one another and make more efficient use of their time. 

Innovation can also come from cutting-edge research and development. This type of innovation often creates new products or services that are not possible with the current technology. For example, Google’s Nexus series devices allow users to access new apps and features without having to worry about getting your hands on an outdated model. 

There are many different types of innovation that can be successful in different industries.

Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. They can be things as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or something much more ambitious. But whatever they are, they need to be on the mind of someone who is thinking about creativity and its role in their work. Here are some creative ideas to get your creative juices flowing: 
1) Create a new way of visualizing an old problem. One way to explore this would be to take a different view of a familiar problem. For example, you might think about how to visualize a situation where you have no idea what will happen next. This could lead to some interesting brainstorming sessions! 
2) Take on an unconventional challenge. Another way to get creative is by taking on an unconventional task that you know you can do but that others might not think of as being creative.
