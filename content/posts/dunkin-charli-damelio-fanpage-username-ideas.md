How to Start and running a blog: How do you go about setting up and running your own blog, both online and in print?
Setting up and running your own blog can be a daunting task, but with some thoughtful planning and execution it can be a rewarding experience. Here are three tips to help you get started:
1. Choose the right platform: Whether you want to run your blog on your computer or on a phone, make sure the platform is compatiable with your style and content. If you want to create an online presence for your business, choose a web-based platform such as WordPress or Tumblr. If you’re setting up a print edition, consider using e-book readers like Apple’s Kindle or Sony’s Nook.

2. Set up an editor: Not all platforms allow for extensive editing of posts, so it’s important to set up an editor before starting the blog tour process.
