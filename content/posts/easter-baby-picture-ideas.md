CUSTOMER SERVICE: What do you think about customer service?
Most people consider customer service to be a very important aspect of their overall business. There are many different ways that customers can contact customer service and these days, there are even online tools that allow customers to do this from anywhere. In addition, many businesses now provide live support during regular business hours, so customers can get help without having to wait in line or go through a long process.
However, there are still some complaints about how well customer service is done. Some customers feel that the staff is too busy or unhelpful and they don't receive the attention they need. Others find the processes difficult or time-consuming. In any case, it's important for businesses to ensure that they provide good customer service and that their employees are aware of how to treat those who visit them.
