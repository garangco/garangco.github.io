The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Creative, Aesthetic, Analytical, and Formal
Creativity is a by-product of the human brain. It can be described as the ability to come up with new ideas, or come up with solutions to problems that others have difficulty solving. Intuitive creativity is the most natural form of creativity, and it comes from within. Analytical creativity is when someone uses their intelligence to process information and come up with new ideas. Formal creativity is when somebody creates beautiful artwork or designs.
