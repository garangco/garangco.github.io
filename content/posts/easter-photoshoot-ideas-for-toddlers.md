conclusion
This is the conclusion of an article on big ideas. 
There are many different types of big ideas, but this roundup provides a few key takeaways. First, big ideas can be helpful in problem solving and coming up with new ways to do things. They also can help us think outside the box and come up with novel solutions to problems we’re familiar with. 
 Second, it’s important to be able to articulate big ideas clearly and convincingly so that others will want to hear them. This is where creativity and speaking confidently comes into play. Finally, it’s essential to keep in mind that big ideas should only be used as a starting point for new thinking; they should not become our full-time job.
