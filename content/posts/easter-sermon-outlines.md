The power of ideas: what are they?
Ideas are one of the most powerful things in the world. They have the ability to change the way we think, feel, and act. They can inspire us to do great things, or help us overcome difficult challenges.
Ideas can come from anywhere – from our own thoughts and experiences, or from other people. Sometimes, all it takes is a single thought or experience to change our lives forever. Other times, it may take many different ideas coming together to create a new way of thinking.
