Overcoming creative blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you feel like you can't think of anything, it can be frustrating. But there are ways to overcome creative blocks. Here are a few ideas: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you feel like you can't think of anything, it's because you've been thinking too hard. Step away from your work and take a break. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. Once you take your mind off of your project, you may find that the ideas start flowing again.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling stuck, talking to someone else can give you some fresh perspective. Brainstorm with a friend or colleague. They may have some ideas that you hadn't thought of before.

Commercializing an invention: What is the commercialization process?
Commercialization is the process of bringing an invention to market and making it available to the general public. There are a number of different commercialization processes that can be used to bring an invention to market. The most common process is license-back, in which the inventor and licensee agree on a royalty schedule and terms of use. License-back usually occurs when an invention is filed with the USPTO. License-backs are also common when a patent application is filed with the USPTO. Other commercialization processes include industriallicense, which involves selling rights to use an invention in a specific industry; technologylicense, which allows manufacturers or other businesses to use an invention in order to create products or services; and netpatent, which allows inventors to make money by selling patents they receive from others.
