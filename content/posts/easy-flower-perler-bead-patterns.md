What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas:

3. Be open to feedback. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!
