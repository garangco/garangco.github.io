Defining creativity:
In order to better understand creativity, it is important to first define it. Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new and original ideas. This could involve thinking outside of the box, being imaginative, and having a unique perspective.
Some people are more creative than others, but everyone has the ability to be creative in some way. There are many different ways to express creativity, such as through art, writing, music, and even problem-solving.

Creativity is often thought of as a rare talent, but with a little practice, anyone can improve their creativity. The next time you’re feeling stuck or uninspired, try brainstorming with a friend or taking on a new challenge. You may be surprised at the results!

Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.

Origins of creativity: How has creativity emerged over time, and what reasons do we have for expecting it to continue to grow?
Creativity has been around for a while, and there are several reasons why we think it will continue to grow. One reason is that creativity is oftenasured in terms of what can be done, rather than what is possible. For example, in architecture, the goal is to create something beautiful and unique, not to solve a problem. This focus on beauty means that architects can often come up with really creative ideas that don't solve any problems. Another reason why creativity will continue to grow is because humans are constantly learning. We constantly learn new things and try new things, so our minds are constantly evolving and growing more creative.
