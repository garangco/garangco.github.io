The creative process: How do we go about creating art?
Creative process: how do we go about creating art?
In order to create art, there are a few key stages that must be gone through in order to produce successful pieces. Here are some tips on how to get started: 

1. Understand your purpose or vision for the artwork. Once you have a clear idea of what you want your piece to represent, it’s important to figure out how you want it to look. This can involve designing the layout and graphics yourself, or using free software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. 
2. Be honest with yourself and others. When starting out, it’s important not try to be too artsy or fancy. Just aim to create something that is interesting and engaging for your audience- whether that’s friends, family, or strangers.

Commercializing an invention: What is the commercialization process?
Commercialization is the process of bringing an invention to market and making it available to the general public. There are a number of different commercialization processes that can be used to bring an invention to market. The most common process is license-back, in which the inventor and licensee agree on a royalty schedule and terms of use. License-back usually occurs when an invention is filed with the USPTO. License-backs are also common when a patent application is filed with the USPTO. Other commercialization processes include industriallicense, which involves selling rights to use an invention in a specific industry; technologylicense, which allows manufacturers or other businesses to use an invention in order to create products or services; and netpatent, which allows inventors to make money by selling patents they receive from others.

Implementation: What are the steps involved in developing a big idea?
When it comes to big ideas, implementation is key. In order to put your big idea into action, you'll need to have a clear plan and follow the steps involved in developing it. Here are some key things to keep in mind: 
1. Have a strong idea - before you can develop a plan for implementation, you need a strong idea of what you want your big idea to achieve. this may include laying out a clear vision or goal, answering key questions about what users would need and desires, and designing an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases your concept. 
2. Develop an MVP - Once you have a strong idea of what your big idea is, it's time to develop an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases it. This will help validate your hypothesis and get user feedback so that you can continue developing the product with greater confidence.

The different types of ideas
Ideas can be classified by how they are approached. There are three main types of ideas: problem, solution, and goal. Problem ideas come up with a unique solution that solves the problem at hand. Solution ideas come up with a new way of doing something that solves the problem, but may not be what was originally proposed. Goal ideas are the final solution to a problem or goal. They come up with a specific plan or destination that is aimed at getting somewhere else.
