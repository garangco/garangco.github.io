What are some new ideas?
A recent report on the future of technology suggests that a number of new ideas are emerging for improving ways to connect people and create opportunities. One such idea is the use of robots to help with tasks that traditional humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as packaging goods, loading onto a truck, or cleaning. Another is the development of artificial intelligence (AI)powered assistants that can assist people with their day-to-day tasks, from booking appointments to grocery shopping. While these ideas may seem like small tweaks to existing workflows, they could have large implications for businesses and society as a whole.

The bottom line: the benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are well-documented and undisputed. Brainstorming allows individuals to generate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and create solutions to problems. Brainstorming also fosters creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.
Despite the clear benefits of brainstorming, many people still hesitate to engage in this type of thinking. One reason for this may be the fear of judgement or criticism. Others may simply not know how to brainstorm effectively.

Fortunately, there are a few simple guidelines that can help make brainstorming more productive and less intimidating. First, it is important to suspend judgement during the brainstorming process. This means that all ideas should be welcomed and explored, no matter how “out there” they may seem at first. Secondly, it is helpful to set a time limit for each brainstorming session.
