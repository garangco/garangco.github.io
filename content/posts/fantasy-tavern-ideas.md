Types of creativity: Abstract, Functional, Symbolic.
Creative arts are any art that is based on the creative process. These artists use their creativity to create something new and original. Creative arts can be found in all genres, but some are more popular than others. There are several different types of creative arts, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
Functional art is often seen as the most creative type of creative art. It is based on simply completing a task or completing a goal. Functional artists are usually able to see the world in a specific way and they don’t need much inspiration to create their work. This type of artist often relies on intuition and common sense rather than studying or learning from others.

 Symbolic art is often seen as the second most creative type of artistic creation. This type of artist uses symbols to represent ideas or concepts that they want to communicate through their artwork.

The benefits of brainstorming.
When it comes to problem-solving, brainstorming is key. By coming up with as many ideas as possible, you increase the chances of finding the best solution. Brainstorming also allows you to think creatively and come up with ideas that you may not have otherwise thought of.
In addition to being a great problem-solving tool, brainstorming can also help improve your team’s communication and collaboration skills. By working together to come up with ideas, team members can learn to better communicate with one another and understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses.

So next time you’re faced with a problem, don’t hesitate to gather your team together for a brainstorming session. You may just find the perfect solution – and have a lot of fun in the process!
