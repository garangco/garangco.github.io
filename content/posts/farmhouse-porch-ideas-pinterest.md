The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

What are the different types of art you can create? What is the difference between creative and non-creative art? Why is creativity important?
Creative art is often characterized by its unique and expressive elements. It can be considered to be an individual form of expression, or a way to express oneself. Non-creative art, on the other hand, is often based on the same parameters as creative art but does not typically have as much expressive power. It can be considered more bland or conventional.
