The Creative Process: How do you get started?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but the most successful creative projects always start with a few key premises. Sometimes these premises can be as simple as starting with an idea and working from there, or as complex as dreaming up an entire world full of new possibilities. Whatever the starting point, however, itâ€™s important to keep things simple and focus on the task at hand. After all, creativity is about seeing things in a different light and coming up with new ways of seeing things.

What are some common ways to generate ideas?
Ideas can come from a variety of places, including the mind, the heart, or the spirit. They might be sparked by something you see around you or hear in conversation, or they might be made up on your own. But whatever their source, ideas are a powerful thing and can help you think of ways to improve your life or solve a problem. Here are four tips on how to generate more ideas: 
1. Take some time for yourself â€“ especially if you find that you donâ€™t typically have time for creative thinking. When youâ€™re not busy creating, or when it feels like work is taking up all your time and energy, try doing something else thatâ€™s both challenging and rewarding. This could be anything from reading an interesting book to taking a walk outside.
