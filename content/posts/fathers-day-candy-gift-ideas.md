The Basics: How do you choose the right tools and materials for a DIY project?
When starting a DIY project, the first step is to decide what you want to do. This can be broken down into five categories: tools, materials, method, tools and techniques, and time. Now that you have an idea of what you need and want, it's time to choose the right tools and materials for your project.
Tools
Choose the right tool for the job. There are many different types of tools available which can be used for a variety of tasks. Make sure you have a good understanding of what each tool is used for before beginning your project. For example, if you are building a box shaped like an S, then a saw would be the best tool to use because it is able to cut through wood very easily.

Creative process: How do inventors come up with new ideas?
Invention ideas come in many forms, but one of the key aspects of creativity is coming up with new ideas. In fact, according to a study by Vanderbilt University, more than half of new business ventures are born out of an original idea. This is why it's important for inventors to have a creative process that allows them to come up with new ideas. By following this process, they can better identify potential solutions to problems and create innovative products or services that can be successful.

Invention process: How do inventors create new ideas?
Invention processes vary depending on the type of invention, and how new ideas are created. Some common methods include brainstorming, R&D, and ideation. Inventors often use different methods to create new ideas.
 brainstorming is a process where inventors come up with new ideas by thinking about what they don't know. The inventors can use any tool to help them come up with new ideas- such as paper, pencils, or a computer.

R&D is another name for brainstorming. It involves researching what other people have done and finding potential problems that could be solved by using a certain idea. This can take place in the form of studies or prototypes.

Ideation is another way to create new ideas. It's when inventors think about things that have never been thought of before and come up with possible solutions to problems.

How can you come up with creative ideas?

This can be hard to come by, but there are a few ways to get started. Here are five tips for coming up with creative ideas:

Before you finalize any of your ideas, take some feedback from friends, family or colleagues.
