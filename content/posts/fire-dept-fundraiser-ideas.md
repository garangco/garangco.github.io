what is creative art?
Creative art is a process of creating something new, whether it’s a painting, sculpture, dance, or story. It’s about using your imagination to create something that didn’t exist before.

Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale.
