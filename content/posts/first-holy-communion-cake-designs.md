Inventions can be anything from cooking utensils to cars. However, some of the most famous and iconic inventions in history were also created with just a few pieces of hardware. For example, the wheel was invented by a man named Musa Acar who used a simple piece of wood and a stone to create the first true bike. Similarly, the telephone was created with just two wires and a wooden box.

History of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating a new product, service, or technology that is different from those that have been existing before.
