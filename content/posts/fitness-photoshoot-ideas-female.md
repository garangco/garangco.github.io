The Structure of the article: What are your thoughts on the structure of an article? Are you thinking about writing a top 5 or 10 list, or doing a more traditional approach with each section)?
There are a lot of different ways to write an article, and the structure of an article is definitely one of them. The structure of an article can be broken down into four main categories: introduction, body, conclusion, and discussion. 
1) Introduction: This is where you introduce your readers to your topic and give them a brief overview. 
2) Body: This is where you start your story and tell your readers everything they need to know to enjoy the rest of the article.
3) Conclusion: This is where you wrap up your story and let readers know what you think about it. 
4) Discussion: This is where you have reader-led conversations in order to get feedback from them.

Types of creativity: There are three types of creativity: Play, Discovery, and Invention.
Creativity is a wide term and can mean many different things to different people. To some, creativity means coming up with new ideas or concepts. To others, it refers to the act of creating something from nothing.
Invention involves coming up with a solution to a problem or completing an unfinished task. Play is another form of creativity where people are focused on experiencing new experiences and having fun.

All three types of creativity can have positive and negative effects on individuals and businesses alike. If you're looking for ways to increase your creativity, it's important to understand the reasons behind each type and how they can be used in your work environment.

How do you know if your ideas are big enough?
Big ideas can be hard to come by, but they can be incredibly powerful. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, the first step is to find the right people to create it and market it. Once you've got your idea out there, it'll be up to you to see if it becomes a reality. If you're not sure if your idea is big enough, there are a few ways to determine whether or not it's possible to execute successfully. 
The first way is through market research. This process involves collecting data about what people want and how they feel about products or services. Once you've gathered this information, you can begin developing an idea for something that will appeal to all types of people. 

Another way of determining whether or not your idea is big enough is through financial analysis.
