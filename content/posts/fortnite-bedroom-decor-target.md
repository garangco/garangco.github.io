Conclusion: What are the benefits and pitfalls of having ideas?

The history of invention: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention has always been a part of history. However, the way it has changed over time can be told by looking at some of the most famous inventions. Here are 8 examples:
1. The printing press: Invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, this device allowed for the publication of books by creating a new form of communication.
2. antibiotics: It was thanks to Alexander Fleming that we were able to treat infections with antibiotics in the 1940s.
3. jet engines: The Wright brothers first developed jet planes in 1903, and they were eventually able to build them into successful machines.
4. LED lights: LED lights were first invented by Charles Babbage in 1876, and they soon became popular for use in televisions and other devices.

This can be seen in our ability to focus and think clearly, as well as in our decision-making process. Brainstroming is the term used to describe this process of thinking specifically.

Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.

Definition of Innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods?
There are a few key distinctions between innovation and traditional methods when it comes to how it is defined. Innovation typically refers to new or different ways of doing something, while traditional methods usually refer to older, more common ways of doing things. Some other key differences include that innovation often involves trying different things out and seeing what works, while traditional methods often rely on certainties and expectations which can often lead to disappointment. Despite these differences, however, both types of innovation can have important implications for businesses and society as a whole.
