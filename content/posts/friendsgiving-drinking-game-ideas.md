1. A deep connection to the individual audience or subject matter.
2. An ability to evoke strong emotions in the viewer or listener.
3. Uniquely configured elements or techniques that create an original experience.
4. A style that is not easily reproduced or adapted without significant additional work or creativity required from the artist.

Painting the Walls: A guide on how to get the job done right.
If you're looking to paint the walls yourself, there are a few things that you'll need before getting started. First, you'll need a hammer and nails. Next, you'll need a drill or an impact driver. Finally, you'll need some painting supplies: paint, brushes, and a palette. Here's a guide on how to get the job done right: 
1) Begin by sketching out your design on some paper. This will help you to plan out the colors and features of your wall. 
2) After drew up your design, start by measuring the space that you want to cover. Once you've determined what size mural you want to create, be sure to add in any necessary trimming and framing. 
3) When it comes time to start Painting your mural, begin by leveling the wall first with a level.
