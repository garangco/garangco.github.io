What are the possible solutions?
Ideas for the 2022 world are plentiful, but few seem likely to take hold. Even if a solution is found, it could lead to yet another global conflict. Here are some ideas that could help make the world a better place: 
1. A ban on hunting animals in national parks and nature reserves. This would help to conserve resources and protect wildlife from being hunted down and killed for sport.
2. A crackdown on money laundering and terrorist financing. Money laundering and terror financing are two of the most heinous crimes that can be committed, and they can have serious consequences for both individuals and countries. This crackdown would help to prevent these activities from happening and could have a positive impact on society as a whole.
3. More access to education for all people.
