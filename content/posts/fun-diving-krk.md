How do you think about creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be hard to come by, but they can also be some of the most fun you ever have. If you're looking for ways to spice up your life or simply come up with new and creative ideas, here are a few tips. 
Start with brainstorming: This step is all about taking your creativity and turning it into something productive. What do you think could be done better? What would make this idea more interesting? Once you've narrowed it down, start thinking about how to make it happen. 

Take a look at examples: Another great way to get started is by taking a look at other people's work. What do they do that you don't? How can you improve on what they did? Once you have some inspiration, it's time to start coming up with your own ideas.

New ideas are always exciting, no matter how old they may be. For example, consider the idea of a "universal basic income." This would be a monthly payment to every citizen that is free of charge, regardless of their income. This would help to encourage people to work and improve the economy. Additionally, there are many other potential ideas that could be implemented into society if given enough time and thought.
