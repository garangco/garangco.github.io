Origins of Invention: What inspired people to invent?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, method or product that has not been invented before. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to make bread dough, or developing a new agricultural technology. In some cases, Invention can even come from scratch – someone comes up with an idea for a product and starts production. There are many sources of Inspiration for Invention, and it can come from anywhere in the world.
There are several reasons why people might come up with an Invention. Sometimes people have an Idea because they are frustrated with their current situation, or they see an opportunity that they haven't seen before. Sometimes Invention comes about because of observing others in their environment and noticing how they solve problems.

The history of innovation: Why has it been so important in human history?
Innovation has been one of the most important aspects of human history, reliably helping to make our lives better. But what exactly is innovation? And how has it been so important in human history?
Innovation, as we understand it today, comes from creating new and improved ways of doing things. It can be something as simple as a new way to produce food or a better way to process oil. However, innovation can also include more complex ideas, like coming up with a new way to use energy or developing a new type of locomotive.

What makes innovation so important is that it often leads to improvements in people’s lives.
