The value of feedback: How important is it to get feedback on ideas before they are implemented?
Feedback is an important part of any business. It can help you make sure your ideas are a good fit for the company, and it can help you improve your products or services. But getting feedback on ideas before they're implemented can be just as important. If you don't get feedback, you could end up implementing something that's not really what you wanted or was hoping for. Feedback can also help you learn how to improve your business model and improve the way your products and services are delivered. It's worth getting it, whether it's through surveys or informal conversations with employees.
