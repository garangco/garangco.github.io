Inspiration: How does one getInspiration for their work?
Creativity is a vital part of any work. Without creativity, there would be no point to starting a project and wouldn't be anything to look forward to during the process. However, getting inspiration for one's work can be difficult. There are many ways to get inspiration, but it all comes down to finding what works for you and your personal style. Here are some tips on how to get inspired for your next project:

Invention, as any creative act, is the result of a collaboration of many people. From the inventor who conceived of the idea to the engineer who designed and built the product, every step in the process is essential to its success. Inventors must be able to see their ideas from start to finish, and must be able to articulate their concepts so that others can understand them.
