How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points
If you're stuck in a rut and need some invention ideas, look no further. This article will give you a few key points to consider when brainstorming your next big idea.

Finally, remember that the most successful inventions are typically those that solve a problem or make someone's life easier in some way. With this in mind, think about ways you can improve existing products or come up with something entirely new that meets a need that isn't currently being met.

Improvements you can get from a contractor: How can you choose the best option for renovating or upgrading your home?
There are many ways to improve the look of your home without spending a fortune. By following some simple DIY tips, you can make your home more comfortable and stylish. Here are four easy changes that you can make to your home in no time:
1. Add a new coat of paint. This is a relatively simple change that can update your home's appearance for a fraction of the cost of hiring a professional painter. Just select an appropriate color, mix it with some other old pieces in your house, and you're good to go.

2. Replenish the windows and door frames . A fresh coat of paint can brighten up an already aging building by updating the look and function of the glass elements. Not only will this add character to your property, but it can also be helpful in keeping cold weather out while heating up during summer months.
