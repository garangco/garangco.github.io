Definition of a big idea: What are the consequences of considering something?
Big ideas are a common feature of any innovation, whether it’s in the business world or scientific research. They can be defined in many ways, but here are a few key points:
1. A big idea is an innovative solution to a problem that has yet to be solved.

2. It must have significant implications for the world as a whole, and its potential solutions must be fully realized before it can be considered a "big idea."

3. There is typically no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to developing a big idea, but some commonly used criteria include: novelty, impact/impactiveness, feasibility, and opportunity/opportunity cost.

How to invent something: Share tips on how to come up with new ideas.
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, process or service. It’s a key part of innovation and economic growth. To be successful, you need to have a good idea and the drive to see it through.
So how do you come up with new ideas? There are a few methods you can try:

1. Brainstorming: This is a great way to generate ideas with a group. Get together with some friends or colleagues and just start throwing out ideas. The more outrageous the better – you can always tone it down later. The point is to get the creative juices flowing and come up with as many ideas as possible.

2. Research: Sometimes the best ideas come from understanding what already exists and finding ways to improve upon it.
