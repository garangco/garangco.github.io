Development of an invention: What steps do I need to take?
Invention ideas are something that can be created within a few hours or even less if you have some creativity and the right tools. To get started, you will need to come up with an idea for a product or service and then develop it further. There are a few key steps that you will need to take in order to create an invention:
1. Choose the right target market. This is where you will figure out what your product or service is meant for and who is the best target audience. You can do this by doing market research or by considering customer feedback.

2. Develop the idea thoroughly. Once you have determined your target market, it is time to develop your idea more fully. This includes coming up with a strong plan for marketing and selling your product or service.

How do you find creativity in your artwork?

This can be done in your own artwork or in your everyday life, whichever is more interesting to you.

The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.

How can we make our ideas into actual products or services?
In business, big ideas are the life blood of startups. They can turn into successful products or services with a bit of effort and creativity. But how do you make your big ideas into reality? Here are three tips:
1) Get help from a marketer: A good marketer can help you identify potential customers and convert them into paying customers.

2) Take your time: Start with small, achievable goals first and then move on to more ambitious ones as you get closer to your target market.

3) Be creative: Be open to new ideas and don't be afraid to experiment. If you can come up with an effective way to solve a problem or reach a new audience, your idea will be more likely to succeed than if you try something that's already been done before.
