What are some bad ideas?
The following are some bad ideas that people come up with all the time. Some of these ideas are really stupid and not good for anything, but they get thrown around a lot and people think they might be good. So, here are some of the worst ideas:
1) Making cars into machines. This is a really bad idea because it will make the cars more efficient and faster, but it will also make them more expensive to maintain.
2) Giving away free stuff. This is another bad idea because it won’t help anyone and it’s going to make people less likely to buy things.
3) Creating welfare programs that only benefit the wealthy. This would be a really bad idea because it would create a lot of competition among businesses and it would drive up prices for goods and services.
4) making school harder than necessary.

The Challenge of Innovation: How do we ensure that innovations are successful?
Innovation has always been a challenge. What makes it so difficult is that it often hinges on the right decisions and the right team. Today, with advancements in technology, innovation is even more important. Here are three challenges that need to be overcome if innovation is to succeed:
1. The Myth of the One True Idea
 knapsackers faced a similar challenge when they sought ways to improve their productivity. “There was only one way to do it, and that was by following the recipe,” says Allen Weinberg, MIT mathematician and co-author of The Art of Computer Programming. Even today, some companies continue this paradigm by insisting on using only one approach for every product or service. This limits creativity and variety in the marketplace, which can lead to success or failure in innovation.
