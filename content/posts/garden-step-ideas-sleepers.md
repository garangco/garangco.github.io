Definition of invention:
Inventions are creative ideas that come about as a result of a person's efforts. They can be things like a new product or service, or just some new technology. Inventions can have a lot of different meanings, depending on the person who created it. For example, a clothing company might create a new style that is different from all the others out there. Or, someone might come up with a new way to make something work. There are so many different definitions for inventions, it's hard to say which one is the most accurate. But, whatever the definition may be, an invention is always something good that somebody came up with to improve the world.
