If so, there are a few new ideas out there that could help you take the place of a boss and make more money. Here are three:
1. Start your own business: many people feel like they have no choice but to work for somebody else because their income doesn't meet their needs. But if you start your own businesses, you can control your own income and set your own hours.

When you're developing a new idea, it's important to get feedback from others who can provide valuable insights. But how do you get feedback from those who are not your direct contemporaries or even friends?
