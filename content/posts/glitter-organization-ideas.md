Definition of Innovation: Ideas that improve the quality, efficiency, or effectiveness of life
Innovation is the process of developing a new product, service, or idea that improves quality, efficiency, or effectiveness. Innovation ideas can be specific to a certain industry or field, but they also have the potential to be applied to any area of life. 
One example of an innovation that has been implemented successfully in many industries is the automobile. The development and implementation of efficient and effective car engines has led to increased speeds and efficiency on the road. Another example is the internet. The early days were difficult for website designers because no one had a clear definition of what “web design” meant. However, as technology evolved and more people became comfortable using computers, websites started popping up all over the place. As a result, web design has become one of the most popular areas for innovation today.

Trends in economy: What will be the biggest changes to the economy in 2022?
In 2022, the economy is expected to undergo a number of significant changes. These changes could lead to significant shifts in the way business is conducted and the way workers are employed. Some of the biggest changes that are expected to take place in the economy include: 
-The rise in automation technology will create new opportunities for businesses and workers alike. With machines able to do more than ever before, businesses can save money by using fewer employees and instead employ robots. 

- technological advances will also help increase productivity within businesses. By making it easier for businesses to track data and analyze it, companies can better understand what is working well and what needs improvement. This information can then be used to improve products or services. 

- Economic growth will continue apace, but there may be some minor setbacks as a result of global economic uncertainty.
