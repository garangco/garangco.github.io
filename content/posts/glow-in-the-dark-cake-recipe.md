What are some creative techniques?
Creative techniques can be anything from painting to sculpting to writing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artist, there are a number of creative techniques that can help you get the best results in your artwork. Here are three examples:
1. Use perspective to create depth and interest in your artwork. Perspective is important when it comes to creating images, so use it to great effect in your paintings and sculptures. By understanding how perspective works, you can exaggerate or avoid details that may not look as important on the surface.

2. Use light and shadow to create moods in your artwork. You can use light and dark tones to create moods in your work, or you can use them simply as means of adding atmosphere and character into your pieces. For example, if you want your artwork to feel suspenseful, try using light shadows against dark backgrounds.
