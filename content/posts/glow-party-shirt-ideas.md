What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.

The evaluation of creativity: There is no right or wrong way to evaluate creativity. However, there are certain things that are important to consider when judging whether an artwork is creative.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It is important to note that creativity does not have to be applied in a creative way. It can also be used in mundane tasks, like writing a paper or completing an online quiz. However, creativity is often thought of as a quality that comes from the imagination and free thought. A lack of creativity can lead to problems, such as when an individual cannot come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. In some cases, creativity can even be seen as a bad thing, as it can stop people from achieving their goals.

Some new ideas are born out of necessity, such as in the case of a product that needs to be small enough to carry without being cumbersome, but too large or expensive to create a viable business model around. Other ideas may come from looking at what others are doing and seeing how they could be improved.
