Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.

When it comes to inventions, there are so many to choose from. Whether it’s a new product or a way of thinking, innovation is always something to be celebrated. However, for some inventors, their creativity and hard work go into more than just coming up with a great idea; they also have to bring their inventions to life. And that’s what makes these inventors so special – they not only come up with great ideas but also make them a reality.
