How can you create a big idea?
Creating big ideas is a key part of any business. Here are a few tips to help you come up with your best ideas:
1.Think about what other businesses have done and how they’ve done it. What are their strategies, methods, or processes? This will give you a lot to work with when thinking about your own business.

2.Create an outline of your business idea and then break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you focus on specific areas and make sure that each chunk is important for the whole business.

3.Make sure that your idea is realistic and achievable. If it seems impossible or like too much work, chances are you won’t even get started on it. Go with your gut feeling and see where the market takes you.

What do we mean by big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there's no one definitive answer. What matters most is what the idea can do for people, and how it could change the way they live and work. 
Big ideas are those that are so great they're hard to ignore or forget. They can solve a problem that's been bothering people for years, or help create a new industry or global standard. 
To come up with the perfect big idea, you need to have a vision, be passionate about your project, and have the guts to take on a challenge. But before all that, you need some strong convictions (or at least a willingness to experiment). 
Here are five tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1) Define your problem: Your ideal customer won't always be available or willing to do business with you, so define your target market first.
