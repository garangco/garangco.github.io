Creativity is essential to any invention. Every step of the process from Ideation to Execution should be tailored to increase creativity and improve the chances of a successful product. Here are four tips for improving your invention ideas:

Feedback is key in ANY creative process.

The Future of Employment: How will joblessness and automation impact employment?
As the world progresses, it is important to keep in mind that employment will continue to be a factor in society. This is especially true in the future as technology advances and joblessness becomes more widespread. One way that this could impact employment is through automation. Automation has the potential to reduce the number of jobs by making them more efficient and automated. Another implication of automation is that it could lead to people having less work to do. This could have a significant impact on society as a whole, especially if it leads to large numbers of people living in poverty.

Introduce the topic of ideas.
There are a lot of ideas out there. Some are good, and some are bad. But how do you know which ones are worth your time? In this article, we'll introduce the topic of ideas and explore some ways to tell if an idea is worth your time.
First, let's define what we mean by "idea." An idea is a potential solution to a problem or a new way of doing something. It's something that you can turn into reality with enough effort.

Not all ideas are created equal. Some ideas are better than others. To evaluate an idea, ask yourself these questions:

-Does this idea solve a real problem?
-Is this idea original?
-Is this idea feasible?
-Is this idea valuable?
