New technologies, such as those that allow businesses to make changes in their products or services without having to go through traditional marketing or product development processes, are often associated with benefits for the business and individual stakeholder groups alike. These new technologies can provide businesses with new markets and customers, faster turnaround times for products or services, increased efficiency and productivity, and new opportunities for innovation. In some cases, these advantages can even lead to competitive advantages over older rivals.
