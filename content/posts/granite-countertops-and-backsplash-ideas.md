Thebenefits of Invention: What are some of the benefits of invented technology?
Invention can be seen as one of the most beneficial aspects of humanity. It has opened up new opportunities for people to achieve their goals and have a better life. There are many inventions that have been made throughout history, some that we know about and others that we may not. Some of the benefits of invention include: 
-Improved technology: Inventions make it possible for people to use more efficient or effective methods to do things they had never thought possible. For example, when oak trees were used to make bows and arrows, this allowed people to shoot farther than they ever could before.

Creative ideas are something that come to people without warning. They can be something as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or a new way to do something you’ve always done but didn’t think of before.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
