What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.

The benefits of being creative
Creativity is often associated with artistic activities such as painting, drawing, and sculpting. However, being creative goes beyond the arts. Creativity is a way of looking at things differently and coming up with new ideas.
There are many benefits to being creative. One benefit is that it can help you solve problems. When you approach a problem from a creative perspective, you are more likely to come up with an original solution.

Another benefit of being creative is that it can help you communicate better. When you have a new idea, you need to be able to communicate it to others clearly. This can be difficult if you are not used to thinking creatively.

Lastly, being creative can simply make you happier. When you engage in creative activities, your brain releases dopamine, which is a feel-good chemical. This can lead to increased levels of happiness and satisfaction.
