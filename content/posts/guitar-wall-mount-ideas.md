The Creative Process: How do you get started?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but the most successful creative projects always start with a few key premises. Sometimes these premises can be as simple as starting with an idea and working from there, or as complex as dreaming up an entire world full of new possibilities. Whatever the starting point, however, it’s important to keep things simple and focus on the task at hand. After all, creativity is about seeing things in a different light and coming up with new ways of seeing things.
