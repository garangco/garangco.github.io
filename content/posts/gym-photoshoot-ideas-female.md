Types of creativity: Presentation, Idea, Solution, Legacy
Creativity is a vast and ever-changing field. The following are three types of creativity: presentation, idea, and solution. Presentation creativity is the ability to create an effective and catchy presentation that stands out from the competition. Idea creativity is the invention of new solutions to problems that have been faced before. Solution creativity comes in handy when there is no existing solution that can be found. It is the creative rendering of a problem into a solved entity. Legacy creativity is the retention of your ideas after they are finished, whether it be for future use or just to keep them safe and stored away in your brain for future reference.

Creativity is often considered to be a different form of thought than other forms of thought. This is because creativity involves the creation of new ideas and concepts that are not possible in other forms of thought. It is important to remember, though, that creativity does not require an empty mind or an expansive imagination. In fact, creativity can be developed through any type of activity that allows for thinking outside the box.

There is no one right way to approach invention
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or approach to something. There are many different ways to approach invention, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some people believe that the best way to approach invention is to come up with as many ideas as possible, and then experiment with them until you find the one that works best. Others think that it's better not to try anything at all, and instead just wait for an idea to come along that they can use in their business or product. There is no right way to approach invention, and it depends on the person working on it.
