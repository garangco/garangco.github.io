What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design. Innovation is key to businesses and societies, both here in the United States and around the world. And while it can come from any form of creativity-from simple change to groundbreaking technology-invention has a special history and meaning in America.
It was on July 14, 1776, when Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence, which declared that each state was an independent nation with its own rights and destiny. Inventions dating back to ancient Greece and Rome had helped make these ideas a reality. But what made America unique? The answer lies in its history of innovation, not just as a country but also as a place where people from all walks of life could come together to share their ideas and dreams.

Innovation is at the heart of American identity.
