Invention 3: A way to store energy
Invention 3: A way to store energy. 

Energy storage has been an issue for a long time. The traditional storage methods such as fossil fuels or nuclear power are not sustainable in the long term. 
But, using renewable energy sources can solve this problem. 
There are many ways to use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and waterpower to create electricity. However, the best option is solar. This is because it is easy to produce and reliable in the short run. 
Solar panels can be placed on roofs or in buildings, which makes them very affordable and easy to use. Moreover, they are very efficient in converting sunlight into electrical energy. 
 Wind turbines can also be used to generate electricity from the wind. However, these have high installed costs and need good location for installation.

The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.
