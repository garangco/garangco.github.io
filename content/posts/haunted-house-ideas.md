Types of creativity: What are the types of creativity?
Creativity can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas or visions. This definition could be used to describe almost any creative act, but art is an especially good example because it is often associated with creativity.
There are many types of creativity, but some of the most common are: visual, musical, and acoustic. Visual creativity includes thinking outside the box and coming up with original ideas or concepts. Musical creativity includes creating music that is unique and inspires emotions. Acoustic creativity includes creating sounds that are unique and inspire feelings or emotions. These three types of creativity are just a few examples; there are countless other creative acts that can be done without using these three specific terms.

If you think about it, Creativity seems like a pretty basic concept.
