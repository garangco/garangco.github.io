What are some creative ideas?
There are endless creative ideas to come up with, and the best way to find them is by brainstorming with a group of people. Here are eight creative ways to spark your imagination: 
1. Start a blog and write about anything that crosses your mind. This can be your personal thoughts or something you read in the news. You don’t have to be perfect – just share what’s on your mind!

2. Draw inspiration from nature and start painting scenes from around town or in your backyard. Add some animal characters for added fun!

3. Get organized and make a list of all the things you want to do before you die (or at least before you retire). Once you have a complete list, it will be easier to prioritize what’s most important.

What is the definition of big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be difficult to come by. There are a few things that make big ideas successful, and those things depend on the individual. Some people find it easy to come up with big ideas, while others may have to work hard to come up with them.
The most important thing is that big ideas should have a clear vision and purpose. They need to be interesting and useful, and they should be something that people can be excited about. Once they’re developed, big ideas need to be abandoned if they don’t meet these requirements.

If you want to find out what makes big ideas successful, you need to ask yourself a few questions. What are your goals? What does the audience want? What do you think will make the idea interesting and user-friendly? Are you worried about potential roadblocks or problems?
