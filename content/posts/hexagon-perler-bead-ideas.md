Definition of creativity: what does it mean to be creative?
Creativity has been described as the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. It is often seen as a trait that is essential for success in any field, but what does it actually mean? In general, creativity means coming up with new ways of looking at things or thinking about why something exists. When it comes to art, creativity can refer to anything from creating new designs for clothing to working on a new painting. However, it usually refers to the process of coming up with creative ideas and solutions. This can be difficult, but it is also rewarding if those ideas turn out to be successful.

What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many to choose from. Here are a few that stand out to us:
-Start with what you know. What are your interests and passions? What do you like and don't like in the world around you? Start with that and work from there.

-Think outside the box. If you're not sure what to do, think about what other people have done or said that might be of interest to you. This can give you some great ideas for things to try or projects to take on.
