History of Invention: How did inventors come up with new ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different sources, but the most common origins are as a result of inspiration or thought. Inventions can come in many forms- from simple devices to complex machines. Sometimes, an idea for a new product is born out of pure boredom or curiosity. Other times, an inventor may simply have the perfect solution to a problem that he or she has been experiencing. Whatever the case may be, history has shown that inventors often come up with new ideas based on their own experiences and observations.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of coming up with new, better ways to do something. It can come from ideas, research, and development (R&D), or even from manufacturing or design. Innovation is often different than other types of innovation, such as creativity or efficiency.
Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas that are different from what has been done before. It can come from brainstorming and poking around in your own mind, or from talking to others about what they have come up with. Innovation also comes from seeing things in a new way, whether it’s when you come up with a new product idea or when you fix an old one.
