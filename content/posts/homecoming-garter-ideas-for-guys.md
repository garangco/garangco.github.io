How to make simple changes that can improve your home
Making simple changes to your home can improve its overall design, function and livability. Here are a few tips to get you started: 
1. Remove any obstacles from your way - remove any fliers, posters or other adornments that areinghamatairport-style wallpaper or carpets. You don't need them and they can add clutter and unsightliness. 
2. Make the living area more inviting - create a dividers wall between the bedroom and living room if you have one and make use of natural light instead of artificial light fixtures. This will help to create a more relaxing environment for spending time in your home. 
3. Add some storage - adding some storage boxes, cupboards or other containers on either end of the couch can seem like a small change, but it can make a big impact in how your home feels and looks.
