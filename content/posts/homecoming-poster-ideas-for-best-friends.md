How is innovation used in the business world?
Innovation is a key component of business success, as it can help businesses improve their products or services, increase sales, and even create new markets. However, it can also be challenging to manage innovation effectively, which is why companies often rely on outside experts to help them work on projects. 
While there are many different ways that innovation is used in the business world, three main methods are structural, process, and product/service system innovations. Structural innovations help businesses change their symbols or branding to create a new standard in the industry. Process innovations can make it easier for customers to order or buy products online or through phone calls. Product/service system innovations can allow companies to improve the overall efficiency of their operations by making changes to their entire supply chain.

How can innovation be used to improve businesses?
Innovation is a key element of business success. It can be used to improve businesses by providing new and unique solutions to problems, or by creating new ways to do business. There are several ways that innovation can be used in business, but some of the most common are: 
1. Innovation can help businesses increase sales and profits. When businesses use innovation to create new products or services that are more successful than those available before, they can make more money and achieve their goals more quickly.
2. Innovation can help businesses reduce costs. When businesses use innovation to come up with new ways to produce goods or services, they can save money on both production and marketing costs. This is especially important for small businesses, which may not have the resources or budget to spend on large-scale innovations. 
3. Innovation can help businesses improve customer service.
