The different types of creative art
Creative art is a process of creating something new and original. There are many different types of creative art, each with their own unique process and results. Some of the most popular types of creative art include painting, sculpture, photography, and architecture.
Painting is one of the oldest and most popular forms of creative art. It involves using a brush to apply paint to a surface, often canvas or paper. Painting can be done in a variety of styles, from abstract to realistic.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be a new product, a new way of doing something, or a new process. Inventors are people who come up with new ideas and find ways to make them work.
The invention process generally includes four steps: coming up with the idea, developing the idea, testing the idea, and commercializing the idea. Inventors typically use their creativity and knowledge to come up with an initial idea. They then develop that idea by doing research, making prototypes, and testing their invention. Once they have a working prototype, they commercialize their invention by marketing it and selling it to consumers.

Inventions can be big or small. They can be life-changing or just make someone's life a little easier. But all inventions start with an idea.
