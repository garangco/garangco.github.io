Whatever the process, creativity is often required for the creation of beautiful and unique works of art.

What‚Äôs in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status.

This would lead to opportunities for businesses and individuals to make more intelligent decisions without having to rely on a human intermediary. This could have a significant impact on many industries, including finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. One of the biggest questions that will need to be answered is how these technologies will be used and what implications they will have for the workforce.
