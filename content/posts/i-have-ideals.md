Types of creativity: Presentation, Idea, Solution, Legacy
Creativity is a vast and ever-changing field. The following are three types of creativity: presentation, idea, and solution. Presentation creativity is the ability to create an effective and catchy presentation that stands out from the competition. Idea creativity is the invention of new solutions to problems that have been faced before. Solution creativity comes in handy when there is no existing solution that can be found. It is the creative rendering of a problem into a solved entity. Legacy creativity is the retention of your ideas after they are finished, whether it be for future use or just to keep them safe and stored away in your brain for future reference.

What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are everywhere. Whether it’s on a T-shirt, in your head, or on the internet, there are always new and innovative ways to approach problems and solve problems. 
There are many types of ideas, but here are three that stand out the most to me: 
1. The brainstorming method: This is a great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Simply take some time and brainstorm all of the different options until you have a few that you like the best.
2. The problem/solution process: This is another great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Once you have a few good ones, you can start working on solving the real world problems that they address.

Creativity and risk: What are some dangers of being creative?
Creativity is a good thing, right? After all, creativity is what allows people to come up with new ways to do things. But being creative can also have dangerous consequences. Here are some dangers of being creative:
1) You might not be able to think of anything new. This is especially true if you're someone who's constantly brainstorming and coming up with new ideas. It can be tough when you don't have any fresh ideas in your head, and that can lead to problems.

2) You might not be aware of the risks involved in your work. If you're working on something that you believe in and care about, it's important to be mindful of the risks involved in its creation. But if you're not sure about the risks, then you might not tell anyone about them – which could lead to them getting hurt or worse.
