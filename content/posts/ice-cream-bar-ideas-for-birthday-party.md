Ideas: How can we use new ideas toOur lives?
There are so many new ideas out there that it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
-Start with a problem. What do you need more of? More money? More love? Something in between? When you start thinking about things this way, you'll be more likely to come up with ideas for addressing your needs in new and innovative ways. 
-Think outside the box. What if there was a way to use something that's usually used for something else? For example, think about using recycled materials in architecture. You could create unique, sustainable structures with ease! 
-Consider your own needs first. What do you need more of in life than money or love? After all, those two things are obviously necessary for most people. But what do you really need in order to feel fulfilled and happy?
