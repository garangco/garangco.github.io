Evaluation: What factors do you need to consider when evaluation your Ideas?
Creative ideas are a valuable component of any business. However, they can also be a challenge to evaluate and assess. There are many factors you need to consider when evaluating your creative ideas. 
One important factor is the quality of your idea. If your idea is low quality, it will likely not be accepted by potential customers or partners. You must also consider the feasibility of your idea- does it actually have a chance of happening? If not, you may need to rethink your pitch and make sure the idea has enough potential to overcome any challenges. Additionally, you should measure the impact of your idea- is it worth risking money and time just to bring it to life? Finally, you must determine whether or not people will actually use your idea- is it something that people would want in their business? If not, you may need to revise or remove its from consideration.

Innovation is essential to businesses in today's competitive environment. By constantly developing new products and services, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive. However, there are a few key challenges that must be overcome in order for businesses to continue to innovate:1) It can be difficult to predict what will work and what won't in the market; 2) Some ideas may not be viable based on the company's current resources or past experience; 3) The novelty of a new product may wear off after a short period of time; 4) There may be some initial costs associated with innovation which can impact business margins; 5) Innovation often requires time and effort - particularly during the early stages of development; 6) Some aspects of innovation, such as customer service, may not match traditional expectations.
