The future of work: What will society be like without jobs?
In 2020, many people are likely to believe that the future of work is one where machines take over most tasks. This is due to the mounting evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more advanced, and will soon be able to outperform humans in many tasks. With so much automation happening, it's no wonder that companies are looking for ways to keep employees on board with the idea of AI taking over work. Some companies are already using AI tools to help employees learn new skills and knowledge, while others are using it as a way to outsource certain jobs or reduce costs. Whatever the case may be, the future of work looks bleak without jobs.

Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.

Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.
