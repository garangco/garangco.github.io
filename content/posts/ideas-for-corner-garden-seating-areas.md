The future of work: What will society be like without jobs?
In 2020, many people are likely to believe that the future of work is one where machines take over most tasks. This is due to the mounting evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more advanced, and will soon be able to outperform humans in many tasks. With so much automation happening, it's no wonder that companies are looking for ways to keep employees on board with the idea of AI taking over work. Some companies are already using AI tools to help employees learn new skills and knowledge, while others are using it as a way to outsource certain jobs or reduce costs. Whatever the case may be, the future of work looks bleak without jobs.

Dark Side of the Coin: How can we make sure that our happiness doesn't come at a cost?
What does the dark side of the coin mean for happiness?
Some people might say that there is a cost to happiness, and this cost can be significant. For example, when people are unhappy, they may spend less money on goods and services, or they may reduce their social engagement. This could lead to a decrease in overall well-being.
There are also costs associated with being happy. For example, people who are happier tend to have healthier lifestyles and have fewer health problems. They also tend to enjoy life more and feel closer to others. These benefits could last for a long time if done consistently.
Many experts agree that there is a cost to happiness, but they differ on how large it may be.
