The Invention of the Telephone
In 1876, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed a signaling system that could be used to send messages over the air. This system, called the telegraph, allowed for communication between distant locations without having to rely on intermediaries. The telephone was created in 1877, when inventor John Ambrose Fleming developed a technology that allowed voice calls over the telephone line. The telephone was an incredibly important invention, not just because it allowed people to communicate with each other more efficiently, but also because it made communication possible from far away.
