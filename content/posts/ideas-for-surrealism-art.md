What are some ideas?
Ideas can be anything from what you want your business to do, to how you can make your product or service better. When it comes to starting a business, there are endless options and possibilities for what you can do. Here are some tips for getting started: 
1. Make an idea list- This will help you come up with ideas for your business that have nothing to do with the products or services that you offer. It can also be helpful to think about how you could improve upon what others have done before you.

2. Get creative- Start by coming up with new ways that you could market and sell your product or service. What if there was a more efficient way to ship products? How about developing a unique selling proposition (USP)? This will help get people interested in your product or service and increase sales potential.

Summary: What are some tips for staying creative in the workplace?
Creativity is key to staying creative in the workplace. There are a few pieces of advice that can help you be more productive and innovative. Here are some tips:
1. Find ways to get out of your comfort zone. When you’re stuck in a rut, try going against the grain and trying something new. This will force you to think outside the box and come up with ideas that may not have been considered before.

2. Be open to feedback. If you’re not sure what someone thinks of your work, give them some feedback and see how they react. It can help you determine if your ideas need refinement or if they work well on their own.

3. Take time for yourself breaks.
