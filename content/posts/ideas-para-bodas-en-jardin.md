The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

Section 2: Why you should allow yourself to be creative.
In order to truly tap into your creative potential, you need to allow yourself the freedom to be creative. This means giving yourself permission to explore new ideas, no matter how strange or “out there” they may seem. It also means not judging your ideas too harshly – remember, even the most far-fetched idea could lead to something great. So go ahead and let your imagination run wild – you never know where it might take you.
