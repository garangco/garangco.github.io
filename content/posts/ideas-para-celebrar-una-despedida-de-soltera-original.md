what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a group activity in which members of a team generate ideas and solutions to problems. The term was first coined by Alex Osborn, an advertising executive, in the 1940s. Brainstorming is often used in business settings as a way to encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
There are several different methods of brainstorming, but the most common is probably the round robin method, in which each team member takes turns sharing ideas. Other methods include free association, in which participants share ideas without restriction, and brainstorming with constraints, in which participants are given certain parameters within which to generate ideas. 

The effectiveness of brainstorming has been debated by some researchers, who argue that it can lead to conformity and pressure to conform to group norms.
