Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.

As the world moves closer to artificial intelligence and machine learning becoming more commonplace, society will face various changes. One of the most significant changes will be how work and life is organized. currently, many people are employed through their companies or by working off of a job contract. With the rise of AI and machine learning, this system could change completely. Instead of having someone employed by their company for a certain amount of time, people may instead be hired as “artificial intelligence assistants” or “machine learning experts”. This would change the way we interact with our machines, as well as how work is done. Additionally, businesses will have to adjust their business models in order to keep up with this new technology.
