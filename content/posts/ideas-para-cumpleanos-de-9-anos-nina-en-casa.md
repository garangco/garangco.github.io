Waste Management: How do you deal with waste when completing a DIY project?
Do you have any extra materials or tools that you don't need and could use on a future project? Do you have old clothes, furniture, or other materials that you don't want to throw away but can't seem to get rid of? If so, there are a few ways to deal with waste when completing a DIY project. 
One way is to bin the material and put it in a landfill. This option is often cheaper and takes less time than dealing with the waste physically. Another option is to recycle the material. This process involves sorting the material by type (paper, plastics, metal) and then putting it into appropriate jars or sacks. The recycling process can take weeks or even months, but it is usually cheaper than trying to get rid of the material physically.
