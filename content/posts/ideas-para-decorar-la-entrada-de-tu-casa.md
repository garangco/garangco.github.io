The history of innovation
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. The first instance of innovation was when early man used a sharpened rock to make a spear. This allowed him to kill animals for food and protect himself from predators. Since then, there have been many other instances of innovation.
The wheel is another example of innovation. It was invented by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC. The wheel made it possible to transport goods and people over long distances. It also helped to speed up production in factories and workshops.

The printing press is another important invention that has had a major impact on the world. It was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century and it made it possible to mass-produce books and other printed materials. This had a huge impact on education and knowledge sharing.

Conclusion: How to come up with big ideas and what they mean for your business or project.
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always apply: think outside the box, brainstorm, and be flexible. With that in mind, here are five tips on how to come up with big ideas for your business or project: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or project to achieve. What problems do you want to solve? What goals do you want to achieve? This will give you a good starting point for brainstorming ideas. 
2. Be open to other suggestions. When you’re brainstorming, don’t be afraid to take other people’s suggestions into account. If someone has an idea that sounds great but doesn’t quite fit your project, don’t be afraid to change it up a bit – after all, this is brainstorming!
