Ideas: What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but they can also be a bit misguided. Sometimes, an idea is great, but it's not something that will actually work. Other times, an idea is great and something that will actually help people, but it might not be the right thing to do. Ultimately, ideas are important, but they need to be judged on their merits.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new and different, whether it be in the form of a product, service or technology. Innovation is essential to the growth and success of any company. By definition, innovation means "a sudden change in the way things are done." In other words, it's the ability to come up with new ideas that can improve a business' bottom line.
However, while innovation is important, it isn't everything a company needs to thrive. In fact, too much innovation can lead to paralysis by analysis, which can prevent a company from taking advantage of current opportunities or changing its strategy in response to new trends. To be successful in the world of business, it's important to focus on both innovation and execution ‚Äì two separate but equally important aspects of being innovative.
