Topic 1: How to come up with new ideas
1. There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes the best way is to just think about what you've seen or heard and then come up with something new. Other times, you may have to get creative. If you're stuck, check out these resources: http://www.thespruceeats.com/new-ideas-2769464
2. It's also important to be open to new ideas if you want to keep your creativity alive. The more you're willing to try, the better off you'll be. One way to do this is by accepting that there may not be anything that fits your idea perfectly right away. That's okay! You can always tweak it until it works for you and still keep the idea interesting.
