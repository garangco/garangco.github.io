Ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. Without them, startups would eventually die or be forced to change their business model in order to make room for an original solution. There are a variety of ways to generate ideas, but the most common approach is to come up with a problem that you can solve. This can be done through brainstorming, tinkering, or even taking on a challenge from someone else. The next step is to come up with possible solutions to the problem.
