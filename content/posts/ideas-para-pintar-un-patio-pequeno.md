How does brainstroming affect thinking?
Brainstroming is a type of self-talk that can have a significant impact on how people think. It's a type of mental practice that helps improve focus, problem solving, and decision making. Brainstroming can be effective when used in conjunction with other cognitive techniques, such as problem solving and critical thinking skills.
