The future of transportation
The future of transportation is anything but what it seems at first glance. The world is about to see a day where people can move around without needing a car, and that’s just the beginning. In fact, many experts say that the days of driving to work or school are numbered. Instead, people will be able to rely on ride-sharing, bikepacking, and other forms of transportation to get around. With these changes in the near future, it will be hard for drivers to remain dominant in the industry.
