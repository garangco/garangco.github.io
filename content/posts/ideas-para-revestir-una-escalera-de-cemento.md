How to develop big ideas
The art of big ideas is key to any business. The ability to come up with original and exciting concepts that can help your company grow is what makes the business world so fascinating. Here are a few tips on how to develop big ideas:
1. Don’t be afraid to ask for help – There’s no shame in asking for help from outside of your company if you don’t have an idea that seems impossible. If you have a great idea, but don’t know where to start, speak with friends, family, or colleagues about your idea. They may have some great advice on how to get started.

2. Get organized – Once you have a good idea, it helps to organize it in some way so that you can better focus on developing it.

Types of creativity: Realistic, abstract, etc.
Creativity is a difficult thing to define. Some people might say that creativity is ideas that come out of the blue, while others might say that creativity is being able to come up with new and exciting ways to do something. To some, it may be easy to see how creativity can be used in art, while others might not have a specific definition for what creative art really is. However, regardless of what someone believes or how they define it, there are definitely types of creativity that are more realistic than abstract and more realistic than creative art.
