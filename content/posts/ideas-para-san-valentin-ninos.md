Conclusion
Concluding a brainstorming session can be just as important as starting one. Here are a few tips on how to effectively conclude a brainstorming session:
1. Thank everyone for their participation. This will help to foster a sense of team morale and keep people coming back to future sessions.

2. Summarize the main points that were discussed. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the goals of the session.

3. Choose one or two action items to focus on moving forward. This will help to keep the momentum going and ensure that progress is made on the goals that were set during the brainstorming session.

4. Assign someone to follow up on the action items. This will help to ensure that they get done in a timely manner and that everyone remains accountable for their part in achieving the goals.

brainstorming: How do you come up with invention ideas?
Do you ever come up with ideas for products or services without knowing what they are? Or how to start thinking about them? In this article, we'll discuss brainstorming - the process of coming up with invention ideas.
There are a few different ways to brainstorm: by yourself, with a partner, or with a team. When brainstorming, it's important to be organized and have an idea hierarchy in mind. This will help you better understand the problem and potential solutions. Additionally, it can be helpful to have specific goals in mind before starting the brainstorming session. Once you've got your goals set, it's time to get creative! You can use any tool you like - including paper and pencils, a whiteboard, a computer screen, or even your iPod - but our favorite tool is a good old fashioned brainstorming session!
