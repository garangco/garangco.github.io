motion picture technology: What were some of the advances?
Invention ideas for motion picture technology include new ways to create realistic graphics and sound, and more efficient filming techniques. Some of the advances that have been made in this field include:

- 3D printing: This technology is being used to create detailed models of objects and characters within films, as well as creating costumes and sets. It has the potential to create much higher quality final products than traditional manufacturing processes. 

- Augmented reality: This technology uses computer software to project digital images onto real or other surfaces. These images can be used to help actors perform scenes more accurately, or even provide clues about the story itself.
