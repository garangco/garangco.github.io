How to come up with a good big idea: How do you assess whether it’s a good or bad idea?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things you can look for. First, is the idea itself? Is it something that could actually work or is it just a pipe dream? If the idea isn’t something you see everyday, it might not be as good of an idea. Next, is the feasibility of the idea? Is it something that could actually happen or is it something you think will only take a while to come up with? Lastly, do you have a clear vision for what the idea should be? Once you have all these things in mind, it’s time toevaluate whether or not the idea is a good one.
