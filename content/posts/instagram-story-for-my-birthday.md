The Process of Invention: What goes into creating a new invention?
Invention can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product or service is created. It starts with the seed of an idea and ends with the final product or service. Key ingredients in the process of invention include creativity, problem solving and collaboration. The process can be time-consuming and expensive, but when it works well it can be exhilarating. Here are four tips for putting your best foot forward when creating a new invention: 1. Take your time – don’t rush your Invention. Even if it takes a little longer than you’d like, taking your time will help you stay organized and focused on your project. 2. Be open to feedback – Get feedback from potential customers, employees or others who may have an impact on how your Invention turns out.
