What is innovation?
Innovation is a concept that has been around for centuries. Some might say it's a result of humans constantly trying to improve upon what has been done before. Others might say that innovation is something that comes about when something new and different is created. There isn't one right answer to this question. What matters most, though, is the concept itself- innovation.

Introduce the topic of creative ideas.
Creative ideas are the core of what drives businesses and industries. They are what inspire people to come up with new products, services, and ways of doing things. Many businesses have creative departments or teams whose sole purpose is to generate new ideas.
There are a number of ways to generate new ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when a group of people get together and try to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or critiquing them. Another way is to look at what other businesses are doing and see if there’s something you can improve upon or do differently.

You can also try asking customers or clients what they would like to see from your business. Sometimes the best ideas come from the people who are actually using your products or services. And don’t forget about your employees!
