Economic Applications of Invention
Invention has a broad range of economic applications, from making new products to improving the efficiency of businesses. Inventions can also have a significant impact on the economy as a whole, depending on their potential uses and impacts. Here are some examples: 
1. Invention can help improve the quality of products. For example, an invention that makes products more healthy or less risky could lead to increased sales and reduce risks associated with manufacturing processes. 
2. Invention can help increase efficiency in businesses. For example, an invention that makes it easier to track expenses or get information from suppliers could lead to faster delivery times and reduced costs for businesses. 
3. Invention can create new markets for products or services. For example, an invention that creates a new type of clothing could bring in new customers and make it more difficult for rivals to compete against him/her.
