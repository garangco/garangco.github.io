Types of innovation:
Innovation is the process of producing a new product, service, or idea that uses existing technology. Innovation can come from a variety of sources, such as creativity, innovation, and risk-taking. 
One of the most common types of innovation is using technology to improve the quality of life for people. For example, Apple has developed technologies that make it easier for people to communicate with one another and make more efficient use of their time. 

Innovation can also come from cutting-edge research and development. This type of innovation often creates new products or services that are not possible with the current technology. For example, Google’s Nexus series devices allow users to access new apps and features without having to worry about getting your hands on an outdated model. 

There are many different types of innovation that can be successful in different industries.

Definition of innovation: What is it, and how does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and unique products or services that solve a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new way of doing something. Innovation can come from anywhere in the company, including the idea behind the product or service, as well as from within team members themselves. In order to be effective, innovation must be mutual and collaborative; it should not just rely on one person’s ideas or insights. 
One key difference between innovation and other forms of innovation is its focus on solving problems. Other types of innovation often seek to create new products or services that appeal to consumers (instead of solving problems), which can lead to less innovation overall. Innovation is instead focused on helping companies achieve their goals by improving their products or services.
