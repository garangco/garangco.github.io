Creative process: How does one go about creating something new?
Creative process is something that many people don't really know how to do. In fact, some people think that creativity is a difficult skill to have and that it's something that only comes from the creative mind. But, in reality, the creative process can be incredibly simple and easy to follow. The key is to use your imagination and think outside the box. And, once you've done that, all you need are some tools and resources to help you along the way. Here are six ways to go about creating something new: 
1) Brainstorm: Brainstorming is one of the most important steps in the creative process because it allows you to come up with ideas for new products or services. It can be helpful to have a few different ideas simmering around in your head while you're working on your project, so it's not too hard to get started.

what is innovation?
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It can be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that solves a problem. Innovation is what allows us to progress as a society and make our lives better.
Without innovation, we would still be living in caves and eating raw meat. Innovation is what led to the creation of fire, which allowed us to cook food and stay warm. Innovation is also what led to the invention of the wheel, which made transportation much easier.

Innovation is not just about creating new things, but also about improving upon existing ideas. For example, the first cars were very crude and unreliable. But over time, through innovation, they became more reliable and efficient.

Innovation is essential for businesses to grow and compete in today’s global economy.
