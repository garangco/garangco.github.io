Invention: How does invention change the world?
Invention has changed the way we live and work, and it could soon change the world again. With new methods of technology coming up every day, it’s hard to predict how innovation will impact our lives in the future. But with some careful planning, there is no doubt that invention will have a large impact on society as a whole. 
For example, imagine a world where cars were not relying on gasoline or oil to run. Instead, they would be powered by electricity or wind energy. This would slash fuel costs and improve air quality around the world. 

Similarly, imagine a world without farm animals. We would be able to produce more food without them and reduce water usage because we wouldn’t need to pour water onto fields just to get food for our animals. 

 Invention could also have an even larger impact on our planet.

Safety basics for do-it-yourselfers: Every project has its own safety guidelines, so be sure to follow them carefully when planning and carrying out a DIY
If you're a do-it-yourselfer, be sure to follow safety basics when planning and carrying out projects. Here are a few tips:
1. Follow local safety guidelines: Many projects require special attention when done by yourself, such as building your own basement or installing a new roof. Cities with stricter safety regulations often have more specific safety guidelines that you must obey. Follow these rules to avoid potential injuries or worse.

2. Use common sense: When planning any project, always use common sense and take precautions before beginning. For example, don't try to fix something without first knowing how it works - this can lead to dangerous surprises down the road!

3. Get help if needed: If you need assistance with a project, don't hesitate to ask friends or family members for help. They may have experience and knowledge that you didn't consider.

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.
