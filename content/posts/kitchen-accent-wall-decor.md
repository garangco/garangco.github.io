What is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate ideas and solutions. It involves a group of people coming together to share ideas and find new ways to solve problems. Brainstorming can be useful in a variety of situations, such as when you're trying to come up with new ideas for a project or when you're trying to find a way to solve a problem.
