The educational process of creativity: How does it happen?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts, is an important part of any successful artist. However, the process of creativity can vary depending on how someone is educated. Some people learn how to be creative through art classes or Leroy Sizemore’s The Creative Process. Others learn it through reading or watching creative minds work. Regardless of how someone learns to be creative, the end goal is the same-to come up with new ideas and concepts that can help them in their artwork and business endeavors.

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.
