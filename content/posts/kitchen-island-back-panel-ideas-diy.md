How does creativity impact our lives: What impacts creativity in our day-to-day lives?
Creativity is an important part of our day-to-day lives. Whether it’s coming up with new ideas for a project or simply enjoying new perspectives, creativity impacts how we see the world and how we interact with others. Creative people are often seen as more innovative and resourceful than their less creative counterparts. In fact, according to a study by The Economist, the average creative person in the United Kingdom earns over £50,000 more than the average non-creative person. This implies that creativity does have a significant impact on our lives in ways that are beyond just creating new things.

What is the best way to organize your home?
There are many ways to organize a home, but one of the most popular and simple methods is to create a system where each room has its own individual category. This can help you focus on your career or other important responsibilities while still having plenty of space to relax and use your home as you please. Here are five tips on how to make this system work for you: 1) Create categories for bedrooms, living rooms, kitchen, family areas, and other areas in your home. This will help you easier find what you need when it comes time to move or rearrange things. 2) Label each category with a relevant keyword or phrase. For example, if you have bedroom categories that include beds, walls, and chests of drawers, then they would be labeled Bedrooms, Walls, Drawers etc.
