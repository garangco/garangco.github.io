How to Choose the Right Painting Scheme for Your Home
There are a lot of things you can do to “paint” your home, but it’s important to choose the right scheme for your needs. A few key factors to consider include: the size of your home, budgeting restrictions, and the style of your home. If you want an artsy home with lots of details or if you want a sleek, modern look, there are many different painting schemes available. Here are some tips on how to pick the best scheme for your home:
1. Decide how much space you want to dedicate to painting. A small home may not need as much room as a larger one, so decide what scheme will work best for you and your budget.

Concepts behind plot and story: What are the elements of a good story?
Plot is the story's backbone, and without a plot, stories are essentially empty vessels. Storytelling has been around for centuries, and there are dozens of different concepts that contribute to a good story. Here are a few key ones:
1) Characters: What makes a good character? Is he or she likable, believable, and relatable? Are they in control of their own lives and choices? Are they interesting enough to follow along with the story?

2) Plot: How does the story go from start to finish? Is it chronological, or does it go in reverse or hops around like an L.A. law student on a bender? Are there any side stories that play into the main plotline? And how important is the climax/ending to the story?
