Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new and better ways to do things. It can be found in everything from designing a product to marketing a company. In today's economy, innovation is key to keeping businesses afloat and ensuring their success.
There are many definitions of innovation, but one that has been shown to be most effective is the "eight-legged stool" definition created by Michael Porter. This definition states that innovation consists of creating new products or services that are different from those currently on the market, as well as making them more affordable and user-friendly.

The term "innovation" can be used in a number of ways for businesses, including marketing, product development, and even company culture. It's important for businesses to understand what type of innovation they need in order to grow and succeed over the long term.
