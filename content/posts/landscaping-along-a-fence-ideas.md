What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative ideas that can change the way we live and work. From developing new transportation systems to improving food quality, there are many ways to put big ideas into practice.
One way to get started onbig ideas is by thinking about what others have done before you. When you come up with a great idea, don’t just credit yourself – give your idea a name and make it a point to share it with others. This way, you can get feedback and help others build on your idea.

Once you’ve got some good big ideas under your belt, it’s time for the hard part: coming up with ways to make them a reality.

The creative process
The creative process is a journey that can be both exciting and challenging. It is a process that requires both left brain and right brain thinking. The left brain is responsible for logical, linear, and sequential thinking. The right brain is responsible for more creative, intuitive, and nonlinear thinking.
The creative process often begins with an idea or a problem that needs to be solved. The first step is to gather information about the problem or the challenge at hand. Once the information has been gathered, it is time to start generating ideas. This is where the left brain and the right brain need to work together. The left brain will come up with logical solutions while the right brain will come up with more creative solutions.

Once ideas have been generated, it is time to start narrowing down the options. This step requires both critical thinking and creativity.
