What if we did something different?
How could we change the world if we only thought about what was best for ourselves? What if we started thinking about the greater good?

Overcoming blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. But don't worry, there are things you can do to overcome this block.
First, try to relax. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay if you can't think of anything right now. It happens to everyone. Just take a break for a few minutes and come back later.

If relaxation doesn't work, try brainstorming. Write down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how silly they may seem. Once you have a list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and developing them further.

If all else fails, talk to someone else about your project. Sometimes it helps to hear someone else's perspective on what you're trying to write about. They might have some good ideas that you can use.
