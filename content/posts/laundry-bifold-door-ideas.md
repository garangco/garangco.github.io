Inspiration from Others: What sources can you draw from?
If you're looking to up your creative game, take inspiration from others. Whether it's learning new techniques or paying homage to classic pieces, there are endless possibilities out there. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
Start with old pieces of art. Draw inspiration from both the beauty and functionality of older pieces. Use them as models for your own designs. 

Create a mashup. What if your favorite song was turned into a visual masterpiece? What if each image in your collection was mashed together into one cohesive work? This is what getting on the beaten path is all about – finding orphaned works of art and turning them into something special. 

Inspire yourself with nature. Take a walk in nature and see how different elements impact how you see things.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new and different, whether it be in the form of a product, service or technology. Innovation is essential to the growth and success of any company. By definition, innovation means "a sudden change in the way things are done." In other words, it's the ability to come up with new ideas that can improve a business' bottom line.
However, while innovation is important, it isn't everything a company needs to thrive. In fact, too much innovation can lead to paralysis by analysis, which can prevent a company from taking advantage of current opportunities or changing its strategy in response to new trends. To be successful in the world of business, it's important to focus on both innovation and execution – two separate but equally important aspects of being innovative.
