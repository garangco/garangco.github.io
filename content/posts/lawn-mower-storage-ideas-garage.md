EHRs are a type of online system where patients can keep track of their health information and see updated information about their care. This would free up doctor’s time to focus on more important tasks, such as patient examination and treatment. Additionally, it would make it easier for nurses to communicate with doctors, since they would have access to all the information the patient has on their record.

The Problem/Solution: How do you come up with an idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to come up with an idea, but following a few simple steps can help. First, identify what you want to create. This can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Next, think about what others may have done or seen that would inspire you. If you have this kind of inspiration, you can begin working on your idea by imagining what people might be able to do with your product or service. Finally, come up with ways to make your idea even better. By doing this, you will not only increase the chances that your product or service will be successful, but also give yourself the opportunity to improve on any mistakes that may have been made in the early stages of development.
