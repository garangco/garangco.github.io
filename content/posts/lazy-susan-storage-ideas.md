There is no definitive answer to the question of what big ideas are, but they can generally be described as ideas that could have a significant impact on a person, company, or society. Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes, and it’s important to find the right ones for your business or organization. Here are five examples:

There are many ways to brainstorm, but the process is always the same: you generate ideas by thinking creatively about a problem or issue. To brainstorm effectively, you need to set aside your judgment and allow yourself to come up with as many ideas as possible. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start to narrow it down and choose the best ones. Brainstorming is a great way to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and get creative.

Stop before you're too far: Sometimes it's better to stop when you're ahead of schedule.
One popular way to avoid becoming too far behind schedule is to take some time off from work and do things you enjoy. This can be done by either creating a plan or just taking a break. Other ideas for dealing with the feeling of being too far behind may include considering using a calendar app to keep track of when you will have other opportunities, setting goals for yourself that you can hit once you've caught up, or using a timer to keep track of how long it will take you to complete a task. When making decisions about when and how to take breaks, it's important to weigh the pros and cons according to what type of work we're doing.
