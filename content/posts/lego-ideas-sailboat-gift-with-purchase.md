In some ways, creative art is even more important than traditional art because it is often used to communicate ideas and thoughts that might not be expressed in other forms.

Definition of a big idea:
Big ideas are those that are so big and complex that they take up a lot of space in a piece, but are actually very easy to understand and implement. Some big ideas may be things like global warming, energy independence, or creating a more perfect society. Regardless of the complexity of the idea, it should be easy to understand why it is important and what could happen if it were implemented.

The different types of brainstroming:
There are three main types of brainstroming: ideational, non-ideational, and scientific. Ideational brainstroming is the most common type of brainstroming. It occurs when an individual has an idea and can't seem to get it out of their head. Non-ideational brainstroming is when an individual has a good idea but can't seem to put it into words. Scientific brainstroming is when an individual has a good idea and can't seem to get it out of their head. It usually happens when an individual is working on a project and they have no other ideas.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything – a new way of looking at something, coming up with new ways to do something, or coming up with a new idea for a product. There are so many creative ideas out there that it can be hard to know what to choose from. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings. When you're looking for creative ideas, take in the environment around you and try to come up with some ideas for products that would reflect the atmosphere. 
2) Be open to change. If you're not sure what you want your product to look like, don't be afraid to experiment and see what different styles work well for you. 
3) Take time for yourself. It's important to spend time relaxing and focusing on your creativity instead of working on things that are taking up your time.

creating: How do you create ideas?
Creative ideas are a key part of any successful business. By understanding how to create and use creative ideas, you can improve your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Come up with a specific idea. One of the most important things to do when creating creative ideas is to come up with a specific goal that you want to achieve. This will help you focus on what needs to be done instead of thinking about every possible option.

2. Look for inspiration. When looking for inspiration, don’t just look at things that have already been done or that have been popular in the past. Check out those that have gone above and beyond in order to get an idea of what you could do yourself (and make sure you avoid copying anyone!).

3. Be flexible.
