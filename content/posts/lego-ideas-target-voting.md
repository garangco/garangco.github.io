Creative Process: How do we begin to come up with ideas?
Creative process is the process of coming up with ideas. The creative process can be broken down into 5 steps: 1. Brainstorming: This step is where you come up with ideas based on what you’ve heard or seen. It can be helpful to take some time to think about the idea and its potential implications. 2. Crafting: This step is where you come up with a specific plan for how to make your idea a reality. You might need to consider how your idea will impact other people, businesses, or even yourself. 3. Implementation: Once you’ve created a plan and crafted an idea, it’s time for the implementation phase!
