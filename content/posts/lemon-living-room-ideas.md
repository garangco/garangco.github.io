The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

A recent study found that there is a problem with too many new ideas. The study showed that the number of new ideas is higher than ever before and this has negative consequences for both businesses and society. The study suggests that businesses should focus on developing old ideas instead of creating new ones, and society should focus on preserving the quality of ideas instead of allowing them to be replaced by more common ones.
