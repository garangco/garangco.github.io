How does the creative process work? How does an artist come up with ideas for their artwork? What are some common techniques used in the creative process?
Creative artists use a variety of creative techniques in order to come up with new and original ideas for their artwork. Some common techniques used by creative artists are brainstorming, problem solving, and imagination. In order to get started in the creative process, artists often need some inspiration. This can come from reading articles, watching videos, or listening to music. Once they have some inspiration, the artist can start to work on creating their own ideas. Sometimes this involves coming up with different ways to depict a certain subject or idea. Once the artist has a good idea for their artwork, they need to put it into practice in order to make it as good as they can. Sometimes working on an artwork takes many different iterations before it is finally finished.

What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!
