coming up with new ways to do things: How can businesses come up with new ideas that work?
Businesses have been coming up with new ideas for years, but it can be hard to pinned down what works and what doesn't. Here are three tips to help you come up with new ideas: 
1. Try different methods of marketing: This might seem like a common-sense tip, but often times the best way to find a new customer is to try something different. Go beyond just traditional methods like advertising and social media promotion. 

2. Be open to change: When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes the best way to find out if something is working is to give it a try and see what happens. 

3. Be persistent: It takes some effort – even stubbornness – to come up with new ideas that work.
