Definition of art: What is it, what does it mean, and why is it important?
Creative art is any art that is created for the sake of creative expression, or to make a statement. It can be found in all forms and mediums, but is most often associated with visual arts. Keywords include: expression, meaning, and purpose. The definition of art has evolved over time to reflect these key concepts.
The origins of art go back to ancient times when people used symbols and images to communicate their ideas and emotions. The Egyptians were particularly skilled at this, as they had a very deep understanding of mythology and religious symbolism. Over time, however, the use of paint and other materials replaced writing as the main form of communication in many cultures. This change was due in part to technological advances, which made it possible to produce large numbers of pictures with greater realism than ever before.
