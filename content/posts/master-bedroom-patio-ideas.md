The impact of innovation on society: What are the consequences?
Innovation has been a key part of society for centuries. It has allowed people to improve their lives and the way they live. However, recent years have seen a rise in innovation and its negative consequences. Innovation has led to new technologies and products that are more accurate, efficient, and powerful than ever before. This has created new opportunities for businesses and individuals to make money and improve their lives. However, there are also some negative consequences to innovation that can be traced back to society as a whole. These consequences can relate to economic growth, social stability, public health, job security, and more. To date, there is no definitive answer as to what the impact of innovation on society is. However, from a policy perspective, it is important to consider the potential implications of any change in how innovation is conducted or accepted by society.

Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The world’s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.
