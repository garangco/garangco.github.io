Brainstorming: How do you gather inspiration for your work?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach? Are you trying to inspire people to do something or just get some new ideas off your mind? Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future? Once you have an idea for a problem, it’s time to start coming up with ways to solve it. Finally, think about how you might approach solving the problem. Do you have any specific examples of how this has worked out before? If not, what kind of inspiration do you need?

Creative Solution: How do I come up with creative ideas?
Creative solutions come in all shapes and sizes, but the key is to find the right one for your needs. Here are a few tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1. Get inspired by other projects you’ve worked on. When you see creative solutions that are similar to yours, it can be easy to come up with ideas. This way, you won’t have to spend hours brainstorming until you find the right solution.

2. Be open to new ideas. It can be hard to be creative when everything else around you is familiar and cookie-cutter. But don’t be afraid to submit new ideas if they seem interesting or if someone else has already created a similar solution.

3. Take your time. Don’t get wrapped up in too much hurry when it comes to coming up with creative solutions.
