How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

The benefits of brainstroming: What it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming, also known as “brainstorming,” is a process by which teams can come up with new ideas and strategies faster and more easily than when they are spread out among individuals. Brainstroming can be used in business, engineering, marketing, and many other areas of work. Here are three reasons why brainstroming is important: 
1. Brainstroming can help you come up with Faster Ideas: When you brainstorm with others, you may end up coming up with concepts that are different from what was initially proposed. This allows you to be more creative and efficient when it comes to coming up with solutions. 
2. Brainstroming Can Help You Come Up With Moreorthern Ideas: When team members brainstorm together, they often come up with ideas that are outside the scope of the original proposal.
