Patents are an important part of the promotion and protection of innovation. They help to ensure that innovations are brought to market quickly, and that companies can continue to make new products and technologies for future generations. Patenting a new technology also helps to protect the intellectual property of creators, ensuring that their ideas are protected long after they expire.
