What are some big ideas?
1. Ideas for big changes or improvements can come from anything, but some things are more important than others. Examples of things that are more important include public opinion, financial stability, and the safety of our citizens.
2. A big idea can be something as small as making a change in how we operate our institutions or something as large as creating a new system that will work better for all involved. There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to big ideas, only what will make the world a better place.

Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of bringing new ideas or products to market using creative and efficient methods. Innovation can be found in any industry, but typically it refers to technology, business, and product innovation.
There are many ways to define innovation, but one way that has become increasingly important is the definition provided by Matt Ridley in his book "The Innovator's Dilemma." Ridley defines innovation as a state of mind: "Innovation always means change, not just alteration of what has been done before." He goes on to say that innovation should be based on the following four factors: creativity, efficiency, novelty, and sustainability.

Creativity is a necessary component of any innovation process; without it, ideas will likely not make it past the initial stages of development.

Defining ideas
When it comes to ideas, there is no one-size-fits-all definition. Ideas can come in many different forms, and they can be used for a variety of purposes.
Some people might think of ideas as being nothing more than a thought or concept. Others might see them as being something that can be turned into a reality. Whatever your definition of ideas may be, there is no doubt that they are important.

Ideas can be the spark that starts a fire, or they can be the key to solving a problem. They can be the foundation for a new business or product, or they can simply help you see the world in a new way. No matter what their purpose is, ideas are essential for driving innovation and change.
