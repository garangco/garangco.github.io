Creativity is not a rare talent; it is a skill that can be learned and developed. Just as we exercise our bodies to stay physically fit, we need to exercise our minds to stay mentally fit. A creative person is not necessarily someone who paints or writes poetry; creativity is a way of looking at the world with fresh eyes and seeing possibilities where others see only problems.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
