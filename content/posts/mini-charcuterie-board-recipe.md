It can be something as simple as an idea for a new product or just a new way of looking at an old problem. Sometimes, the creative process can involve working on different versions of the same idea until one comes to mind that you're inspired to produce.

The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.
