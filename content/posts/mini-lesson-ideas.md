Cultural aspects of Invention: How do people React to Innovation?
When someone comes up with a new invention, people often react in different ways. Some people may be excited by the idea, while others may be skeptical. Still others may just be curious. Different reactions mean that different people have different perspectives on innovation. 
One example of how people react to innovation is through patenting. Patenting an invention means that somebody has made something that is exclusive to them and can't be copied or used by anyone else. This can help protect the inventor's work from being copied or used without permission. 

Another example of how people react to innovation is through creativity. When somebody comes up with a new idea, they may be inspired by it or they might not be. It all depends on the person and their perspective on innovation.
