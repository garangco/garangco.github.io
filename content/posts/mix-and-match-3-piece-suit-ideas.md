Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be an idea, a product, a service, or a process. Inventors are people who create new things. They have inventive minds and are always looking for ways to improve upon what already exists.
The invention process involves four main steps: ideation, development, prototype testing, and commercialization. Ideation is the stage in which an inventor comes up with an idea for a new product or service. Development is the stage in which the inventor turns the idea into a plan and begins to create a prototype. Prototype testing is the stage in which the prototype is put to the test to see if it works as intended. Commercialization is the stage in which the invention is made available to consumers.

Inventions can be either big or small.

brainstorming is a powerful tool that can lead to creative ideas. But it can also be difficult to start brainstorming. Here are four tips to help you get started: 
1. Make a list of the main ideas you want to explore. This will give you a starting point for your brainstorming sessions.
2. Take some time to think about what you want your brainstorming session to be about. What are the main topics that you want to cover? 
3. Get feedback from other people who will help you shape your ideas into a better idea. This can include fellow creatives, business owners, or other people in your industry. 
4. Use the tools that work best for you when brainstorming: paper, pencils, computers, or flashcards can all be used in different ways during a brainstorming session.
