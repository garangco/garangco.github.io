The Types of Ideas: What are the three main types of creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everywhere. They can be found in everything from advertising to architecture to the arts. But what are the three main types of creative ideas? Here are a few examples:
1. Product idea: A product is an idea that a business or individual has for selling its product. A product can be something as simple as a new phone case or a new restaurant dish.

2. Concept idea: A concept is an idea that a business or individual has for creating a new product or service. Concepts can be anything from innovative to unique to futuristic.

3. Design idea: A design is an idea that comes after someone has created some sketches and drawings of what they want their product or service to look like. Designs can range from simple to complex, and they can also be based on existing products or services.
