The Problem: How do we create meaningful ideas?
In order to create meaningful ideas, we need a strong understanding of what those ideas mean and how to put those ideas into practice. Unfortunately, most people lack these foundational skills. In order to get started, here are some basic tips: 
1. Think about what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you determine how your idea can be used and adapted. 
2. Brainstorm with others for feedback andIdea generation challenges can be fun, but also helpful in getting feedback on whether or not your idea is conceptually good or bad. 
3. Come up with a working title for your idea before you even start thinking about it. This will give you an idea of what the word “idea” means and make sure that everyone who hears your idea understands it at its purest form (i.e., without any additional context).

Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.

How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.
