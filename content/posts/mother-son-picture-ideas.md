How do you make your blog stand out from the rest?
There are a few things you can do to make your blog stand out from the rest. Here are some ideas: 
1. Use a unique tagline. This will help people know where they can find your blog, and it will also help you attract more traffic.

2. Make your blog content interesting and helpful. People want to read helpful, informative posts, not just those that are empty calories or boring information dumps.

3. Be funny and entertaining. Blogging is a fun hobby, so make sure your content is both enjoyable and informative too!

4. Be original. When other bloggers start using the same template or style for their blogs, it becomes difficult for them to stand out from the crowd. So be unique and think outside the box!

How can you create a big idea?
Creating big ideas is a key part of any business. Here are a few tips to help you come up with your best ideas:
1.Think about what other businesses have done and how they’ve done it. What are their strategies, methods, or processes? This will give you a lot to work with when thinking about your own business.

2.Create an outline of your business idea and then break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you focus on specific areas and make sure that each chunk is important for the whole business.

3.Make sure that your idea is realistic and achievable. If it seems impossible or like too much work, chances are you won’t even get started on it. Go with your gut feeling and see where the market takes you.
