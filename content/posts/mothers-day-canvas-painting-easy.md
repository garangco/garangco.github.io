Conclusion: What should we do to help achieve our goals in 2022?
A lot has changed since the original concept for the 2022 World Cup was hatched in 2010. So much so, that it’s hard to know where to start. Here are three key points to keep in mind as we move closer to the event:
1. The global football community is more connected than ever before. This has led to a Barnett Formula where richer countries are being forced to invest more in infrastructure and cup tournaments, while poorer ones have less money available. This has created opportunities for nations such as Russia and Qatar to bid for the event, but also raised eyebrows across the world about who should be hosting it – and whether they can afford it.

2. The U21 World Cup is now one of the most important tournaments on global soccer calendar.
