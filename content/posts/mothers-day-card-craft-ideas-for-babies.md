The benefits of big thinking
If you want to change the world, you have to start by thinking big. That’s the premise behind big thinking: the belief that we can solve problems and create opportunities by coming up with large-scale solutions.
It’s an approach that has yielded some of the most important breakthroughs in history, from the discovery of vaccines to the development of nuclear power. And it’s an approach that is increasingly necessary in a world that is becoming more complex and interconnected.

Big thinking is about more than just coming up with big ideas. It’s also about having the courage to act on those ideas, even when they seem impossible. After all, it was a big thinker who said, “The impossible just takes a little longer.

Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.
