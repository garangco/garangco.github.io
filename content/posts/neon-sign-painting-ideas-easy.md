Defining creativity
In order to come up with creative ideas, one must first understand what creativity is. Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. It is often associated with art and music, but it can also be found in other areas of life such as problem-solving, business, and even personal relationships.
There are many different ways to define creativity. Some people believe that it is simply the ability to come up with new ideas, while others believe that it is the ability to execute those ideas in a way that is both unique and effective. Still others believe that creativity is a combination of both of these things.

Regardless of how you define it, there are certain things that are necessary for creativity to occur. These include a willingness to take risks, an open mind, and the ability to think outside the box.

Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.

Brainstorming: How do you brainstorm?
How do you brainstorm? The process of coming up with ideas for products, services, or solutions can seem overwhelming. But there are several tips to help you get started:
1. Break down the problem into smaller chunks. This will help you focus on what is important and make progress.

2. Take a community or professional role in brainstorming. This will give you feedback and allow you to see how others have tackled the same problem.

3. Make a list of potential solutions to the problem. Once you’ve narrowed it down, it’s time to start brainstorming!
