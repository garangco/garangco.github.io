Why should people care about it?
There are many reasons why people should care about climate change, but some of the most pressing ones include: increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events; loss of life due to climate-related disasters; and the high cost of inaction.
One way to help mitigate climate change is by using technology to create more accurate predictions of future weather patterns, as well as developing more efficient energy systems. Other ways to make a significant impact on mitigating the effects of climate change include: investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro; cleaning up our water resources so that they can provide clean drinking water for everyone; improving transportation options so people can access clean energy when they need it; and reducing emissions from industry and homes.
