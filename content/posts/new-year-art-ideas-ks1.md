Take flight!: Are there any other ways you can use your creativity to help solve problems?
Creativity can be used in a number of ways to solve problems. One way is to come up with big ideas. Big ideas are solutions that are large enough to be accomplished, but small enough that they can be implemented. There are many ways to come up with big ideas, so it is important to find the one that works best for you. Some ways to find big ideas include: 
1) thinking out loud – When you have a lot of ideas racing through your head, it can be helpful to take a break and talk about some of them with someone else. This will help you focus on what you want to achieve and avoid getting lost in your thoughts. 
2) brainstorming – This process helps you come up with multiple solutions at the same time and then put them all together to see which one might work best.
