Creative process: How does one go about creating something new?
Creative process is something that many people don't really know how to do. In fact, some people think that creativity is a difficult skill to have and that it's something that only comes from the creative mind. But, in reality, the creative process can be incredibly simple and easy to follow. The key is to use your imagination and think outside the box. And, once you've done that, all you need are some tools and resources to help you along the way. Here are six ways to go about creating something new: 
1) Brainstorm: Brainstorming is one of the most important steps in the creative process because it allows you to come up with ideas for new products or services. It can be helpful to have a few different ideas simmering around in your head while you're working on your project, so it's not too hard to get started.

Tools: How should you use the tools you have?
If you have a few tools that you like to use, it's important to know how to use them in order to get the most out of them. Here are four easy ways to use your tools the right way:
1) Make a toolset: When you have a few tools, it's better to make a toolset rather than purchase individual tools. This will save you time and money in the long run. A good starting point is an electronic toolkit, such as this one from Amazon. You can find other options here.

2) Use common sense: It's important not only to be able to use your tools but also be aware of what they do. If something doesn't work or doesn't seem right, try turning it around and using another tool instead.
