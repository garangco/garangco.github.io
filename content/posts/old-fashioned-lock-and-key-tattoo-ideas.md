Invention is the act of making something either new or better than what was existing before. It can be a simple process or a huge undertaking, and it can be something that someone came up with on their own or something that was patented. Inventions have come from many different sources, including people who had nothing to do with marketing or design, and from a lot of different fields.

Basic Tips for Doing a Better Job: Be sure to follow these Basic Tips before starting any DIY project, and you'll get the job done right.
If you're looking to improve your DIY skills, there are a few things you should keep in mind before beginning any project. Here are some basic tips to help you get started: 
1) Follow the instructions thoroughly - if something isn't working correctly, take it to someone who knows more about it than you do. This will help prevent any surprises down the line and make sure your project is completed on time and without incident. 

2) Have a plan - once you've got the basics down, it's important to create a plan for how you'll go about completing your project. This will help ensure that everything goes as planned and that nothing gets lost in the process.

The five types of brainstorming: open, collaborative, focused, problem-solving, and creative.
Brainstorming is one of the most essential skills for any business or professional. It can be used for creative problem solving, brainstorming for ideas for products and services, and more. However, not all brainstorming sessions are created equal. Here are five different types of brainstorming that can help improve your session productivity: 
1. Open brainstorming: This type of brainstorming is usually used when there is no specific goal to achieve or when everyone is free to come and go as they please. In this type of session, everyone is given a set amount of time to come up with ideas and then those ideas are prioritized based on how important they think they are.

2. Collaborative brainstorming: This type of brainstorming helps teams work together towards a common goal.
