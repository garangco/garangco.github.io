Inventors and their inventions
Inventors are people who create something new that has never been seen before. They come up with an idea, and then turn that idea into a reality. Inventions can be anything from a simple tool to a life-saving medical device.
Some of the most famous inventors in history are Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, and the Wright brothers. Da Vinci was an artist and scientist who invented many things, including the helicopter and the tank. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb and the phonograph. The Wright brothers invented the airplane.

Inventors make our world a better place. They help us solve problems and make everyday tasks easier. We owe a lot to these creative thinkers!

The Impacts of Invention: How does innovation impact society as a whole?
Inventions have been a part of society for centuries, but the impact of innovation has only grown in recent decades. Innovation has the ability to change the way we live and work, as well as the ways we view the world around us. The benefits of innovation are vast, and it has had a positive impact on economies, society, and environment. However, there are some challenges that need to be considered before continuing to see such positive impacts. One key challenge is that innovation can often lead to new technologies that can be dangerous or harmful if not used responsibly. Another challenge is that innovation often depends on someone else’s idea or idea being implemented first, which can lead to competition andefficiency in some industries. Overall, these challenges underscore the importance of ensuring that all who benefit from innovation are taken care of when it comes time for new products or services to be created.

Review: What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new recipe to designing a new piece of clothing. However, some creative ideas are better than others. Here are five creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with the basics: Start by brainstorming what your idea could be. What are some things you can think of that could be used in your idea? Examples might include an ornament, a piece of art, or even a little project for your room. 
2. Think outside the box: Once you have an idea for something, start thinking about ways to make it work. What is something that has never been done before? How can you make it unique and interesting? 
3. Be daring: Don’t just take what someone has already done and create something new; go beyond what people usually think of when they think of creativity.
