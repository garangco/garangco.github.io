Brainstorming Methods: Different ways to brainstorm invention ideas.
1. When it comes to brainstorming invention ideas, there are a variety of different methods you can use.
2. One popular method is called "brainstorming by association." This involves coming up with ideas by associating them with other words or concepts.
3. Another common method is called "freewriting." This involves simply writing down whatever comes to mind, without worrying about whether it makes sense or not.
4. If you're having trouble getting started, try brainstorming with a group of friends or colleagues. You may be surprised at how quickly the ideas start flowing when you're working with others.
5. Whatever method you choose, the important thing is to keep the ideas flowing. Don't worry about whether they're good or bad at first, just get them down on paper (or in a computer file). You can always edit them later.

motion picture technology: What were some of the advances?
Invention ideas for motion picture technology include new ways to create realistic graphics and sound, and more efficient filming techniques. Some of the advances that have been made in this field include: 
- Virtual reality: In a recent study, virtual reality headsets were used to film a movie set in another world. The experience was incredibly realistic, and allowed for a much deeper level of immersion than traditional movies. 

- 3D printing: This technology is being used to create detailed models of objects and characters within films, as well as creating costumes and sets. It has the potential to create much higher quality final products than traditional manufacturing processes. 

- Augmented reality: This technology uses computer software to project digital images onto real or other surfaces. These images can be used to help actors perform scenes more accurately, or even provide clues about the story itself.

Conclusion
Concluding a brainstorming session can be just as important as starting one. Here are a few tips on how to effectively conclude a brainstorming session:
1. Thank everyone for their participation. This will help to foster a sense of team morale and keep people coming back to future sessions.

2. Summarize the main points that were discussed. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the goals of the session.

3. Choose one or two action items to focus on moving forward. This will help to keep the momentum going and ensure that progress is made on the goals that were set during the brainstorming session.

4. Assign someone to follow up on the action items. This will help to ensure that they get done in a timely manner and that everyone remains accountable for their part in achieving the goals.
