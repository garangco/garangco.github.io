Idea 5: A computer game that can be played online.
Computer games have become popular in recent years, with many players finding them to be addictive and entertaining. One such game that has gained a lot of popularity is " FarmVille".

One idea would be to add features that allow players to create their own villages and businesses, which would make for more interesting gameplay. Another potential improvement could be to make the game more challenging, by adding more difficult levels or by providing more rewards for successful completion.

Invention history: What inspired various inventors to come up with new ideas?
Invention history is a fascinating topic to explore, as it offers insights into the creativity and motivation behind inventors. Some of the most famous and influential inventors in history include Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Charles Darwin, and Marie Curie. Each inventor had their own unique ideas that led to new technologies and products. In some cases, these ideas were simply firsts – for example, da Vinci’s drawing of a three-dimensional image in paper was the first use of a technical drawing instrument in history. However, other inventions may have had more significant impacts on society or the economy. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution led to the development of mass produced products like cars and machines. This theory also helped to change how people view themselves and their environment – thanks in part to his invention of the scientific method.
