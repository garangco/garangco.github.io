Creative thinking can help you solve problems
Creative thinking can help you solve problems. This isn't just a slogan, it's a law of the land. And if you're not using it, you're missing out on an opportunity to make some serious strides in your career and life. Here are four ways to get started: 
1. Take a break from reality: Try Problem-O-Maticity or The Break with Reality. These programs ask you to come up with five problems that challenge your current understanding of reality and then see how you can improve upon or even solve them. Afterward, take a few minutes to reflect on what came away from the session and how you would have tackled the first four problems. 

2. Make connections: What does creativity look like? What do different writers, artists, and thinkers share in common that makes them unique?

The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is essential to businesses in today's competitive environment. By constantly developing new products and services, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive. However, there are a few key challenges that must be overcome in order for businesses to continue to innovate:1) It can be difficult to predict what will work and what won't in the market; 2) Some ideas may not be viable based on the company's current resources or past experience; 3) The novelty of a new product may wear off after a short period of time; 4) There may be some initial costs associated with innovation which can impact business margins; 5) Innovation often requires time and effort - particularly during the early stages of development; 6) Some aspects of innovation, such as customer service, may not match traditional expectations.
