What is creative writing and how do you go about creating great ideas?
Creative Writing is the process of coming up with ideas for stories, poems, and novels. One of the main things that creative writers need to do is to be patient. They need to work on their ideas for a while and then come back with a better one. Another thing that creative writers need to do is to have a good imagination. They need to be able to see what could happen in their story and come up with different ideas for characters and plot.

Forms of inspiration: What are some ways to get inspired when you’re working on a project?
Creativity is key when it comes to any project. There are many ways that you can get inspired, and some are more effective than others. Here are a few examples: 
1. Take a walk in the park: This can be an excellent way to get your creative juices flowing. Depending on what type of park you choose, there may be different types of attractions to inspire you. For example, if you’re at the zoo, take a walk around the cages or go see the animals in their natural habitat. 
2. Draw something: This can be done in many ways, but often times there’s something specific that will come to mind when you start drawing or painting. Sometimes all you need is a piece of paper and some pen or pencils!
