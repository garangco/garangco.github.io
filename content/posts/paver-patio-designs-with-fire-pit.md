Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success.

5. Idea culture is important for businesses!
