Creativity and risk: What are some dangers of being creative?
Creativity is a good thing, right? After all, creativity is what allows people to come up with new ways to do things. But being creative can also have dangerous consequences. Here are some dangers of being creative:
1) You might not be able to think of anything new. This is especially true if you're someone who's constantly brainstorming and coming up with new ideas. It can be tough when you don't have any fresh ideas in your head, and that can lead to problems.

2) You might not be aware of the risks involved in your work. If you're working on something that you believe in and care about, it's important to be mindful of the risks involved in its creation. But if you're not sure about the risks, then you might not tell anyone about them – which could lead to them getting hurt or worse.
