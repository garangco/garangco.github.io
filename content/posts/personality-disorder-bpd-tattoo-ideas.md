The Use of Invention
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. For businesses, invention can mean turning a concept into a reality. Inventions have ranged from simple to complex, and often require many years of hard work and dedication. But for some businesses, invention has become an essential part of their business model. Some inventions are so important that they are not only unique but also valuable to the company. These are called patentable inventions.

Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.
