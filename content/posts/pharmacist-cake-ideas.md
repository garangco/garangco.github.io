What are the future ideas for the world?
Some of the future ideas for the world include:
1. Digital disruption – Heavily digitalized societies are prone to more innovation and change than traditional societies. This can result in new opportunities for businesses and individuals, as well as a shift in power dynamics.
2. The sharing economy – A growing number of people are using platforms such as Airbnb and Uber to find affordable housing or transportation. This could lead to increased competition in the taxi and transport industries, as well as a rise in the cost of living.
3. Artificial intelligence – Advances in artificial intelligence are likely to enable machines to learn and become better at problem-solving than humans. This could have a significant impact on jobs and society as a whole, leading to major changes in how work is done and who has access to the best skills.

The evaluation of creativity: There is no right or wrong way to evaluate creativity. However, there are certain things that are important to consider when judging whether an artwork is creative.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It is important to note that creativity does not have to be applied in a creative way. It can also be used in mundane tasks, like writing a paper or completing an online quiz. However, creativity is often thought of as a quality that comes from the imagination and free thought. A lack of creativity can lead to problems, such as when an individual cannot come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. In some cases, creativity can even be seen as a bad thing, as it can stop people from achieving their goals.
