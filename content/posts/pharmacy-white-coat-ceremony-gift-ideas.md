defines what invention ideas are
The definition of an invention idea is up to the inventor. 
There are many different ways to create and patented inventions, so it is important to determine what type of invention you are thinking of creating. There are four main types of inventions: 
1) Product: A product is a physical object that a customer buys or uses. This could be anything from a new appliance to a new car. 
2) Process: This could be anything from baking soda to driving in rain. Inventions that improve or change the way products are made are often called process patents. 
3) Service: Service patents cover ideas that improve the service industry, such as making it easier for customers to find information or resolving problems faster. 
4) Technology: This could include anything from computers to air travel.

The definition of art: What are the key factors that influence its definition?
Creative art is a type of art that is created by humans and often reflects their personal interpretation or feelings. It can be considered to be any form of art that is not just instantly reproducible andmissible, but requires time and effort to produce. The definition of creative art can vary depending on the person, but typically it includes:
1. A deep connection to the individual audience or subject matter.
2. An ability to evoke strong emotions in the viewer or listener.
3. Uniquely configured elements or techniques that create an original experience.
4. A style that is not easily reproduced or adapted without significant additional work or creativity required from the artist.
