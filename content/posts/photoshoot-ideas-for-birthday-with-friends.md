Thesis: What are some new ideas that could help improve our lives?
There are many new ideas that could help improve our lives, but one idea that has been gaining a lot of attention is the so-called “smart home”. This is a concept where consumers can access various services and devices in their homes through a network of connected devices. Smart home technologies have the potential to improve our lives by allowing us to control our environments more effectively, save time and money, and reduce stress. Here are four examples of how smart home technologies could help improve our lives.

Processes for producing innovation: How do outside sources help to produce innovative ideas?
Innovation is a process that begins with the seed, which is the input into which something new is added. From there, the innovation process moves through two stages: ideation and production. In ideation, ideas are generated from scratch and can come from anyone, but usually comes from top thinkers in a company or industry. In production, these same ideas are put together to create a product or service that can be sold.

The first invention: fire
Invention is often thought of as something that comes about as a result of human intelligence and creativity. However, the first invention was not created by humans at all – it was fire.
Before the advent of fire, life on Earth was very different. The planet was much colder and darkness ruled the night. But then, somewhere in the distant past, a lightning strike or a volcanic eruption set a tree ablaze. And from that fateful event, fire was born.

For early humans, fire must have been both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, it provided warmth and light; on the other hand, it could also be deadly if not controlled properly. But over time, we learned to harness fire and use it to our advantage. Today, fire is an integral part of human life – from cooking our food to powering our industries.

motion picture technology: What were some of the advances?
Invention ideas for motion picture technology include new ways to create realistic graphics and sound, and more efficient filming techniques. Some of the advances that have been made in this field include: 
- Virtual reality: In a recent study, virtual reality headsets were used to film a movie set in another world. The experience was incredibly realistic, and allowed for a much deeper level of immersion than traditional movies. 

- 3D printing: This technology is being used to create detailed models of objects and characters within films, as well as creating costumes and sets. It has the potential to create much higher quality final products than traditional manufacturing processes. 

- Augmented reality: This technology uses computer software to project digital images onto real or other surfaces. These images can be used to help actors perform scenes more accurately, or even provide clues about the story itself.
