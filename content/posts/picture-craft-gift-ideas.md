What are big ideas?
In business, big ideas are the seeds of new business models and products. They can be anything from a novel idea to a radical change in how a product is produced. They can also be inspired by something that has worked before, or by something that someone else has tried and found to be successful. 
The key to getting your big idea off the ground is to have a clear vision for it, and then come up with specific goals and timelines for making it a reality. There are several ways to generate big ideas, including brainstorming with friends or family, talking with experts in your field, researching existing products or services, or reading articles on the subject. 

If you're not sure what kind of big idea you want to pursue, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.

Conclusion: Some tips for staying creative.
Creativity is key to a successful life. With the right tools, creativity can be unleashed to achieve anything you set your mind to. Here are a few tips to help you stay creative: 1. Take time for yourself – if you don’t have time for creativity, it won’t flow out of you. Slow down and allow yourself some time for yourself so that you can come back with fresh ideas. 2. Get organized – once you have an idea, try to organize it so that it feels like a project instead of something that just needs to be done. This will help keep your brain active and focused on the task at hand. 3. Be open to feedback – negative or positive feedback will help you develop new ideas and come up with new ways of thinking about things.
