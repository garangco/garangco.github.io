Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be an idea, a product, a service, or a process. Inventors are people who create new things. They have inventive minds and are always looking for ways to improve upon what already exists.
The invention process involves four main steps: ideation, development, prototype testing, and commercialization. Ideation is the stage in which an inventor comes up with an idea for a new product or service. Development is the stage in which the inventor turns the idea into a plan and begins to create a prototype. Prototype testing is the stage in which the prototype is put to the test to see if it works as intended. Commercialization is the stage in which the invention is made available to consumers.

Inventions can be either big or small.
