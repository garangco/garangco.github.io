The Industrial Revolution and Inventions
The Industrial Revolution and Inventions
Invention is often thought of as a lightbulb moment, or a eureka! experience. But invention is also the result of years of incremental improvements by many people. This was certainly the case during the Industrial Revolution, when a number of different inventions led to unprecedented economic growth.

One of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution was the steam engine. The steam engine allowed for factories to be built away from water sources, and it also made it possible to power trains and ships. Another key invention was the spinning jenny, which increased the efficiency of textile production.

Other notable inventions from this period include the telegraph, which revolutionized communication; photography, which changed the way we view the world; and the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine, which would eventually lead to the automobile.

How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.
