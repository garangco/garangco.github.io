Business models: How to make an invention successful?
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen, but the ones that work can be very profitable. Here are four tips on how to make your invention successful:
1. Choose the right business model: Any invention should have a specific business model in mind before you can begin developing it. Make sure that your business is able to pay off its investment, generate income, and attract customers.

2. Get market saturation: Once your invention has reached a certain level of popularity, it will be more difficult to switch it to another business model. To get market saturation, make sure that your product or service is well-received by a wide range of people. This can include both potential customers and competitors.
