How to Innovate
Innovation is a key term when it comes to staying ahead of the competition. By understanding how innovation works, businesses can develop innovative ways to stay one step ahead. Here are three tips to help you achieve success:
1. Look at innovation from a systemic perspective. When looking at innovation from a systemic perspective, businesses should take into account the entire supply chain and the entire market. This means understanding how products and services are used and what opportunities exist for improvement.

2. Try out different methods of thinking. When trying out different methods of thinking, businesses should experiment with different ideas and see which ones work best for them. This will help them determine which innovations are most important to their business and which ones need further development.

3. Be patient with your experimentation.

How to Make Your Home More Functional
Last year, I was faced with a unique challenge. My home was slowly being used less and less as my office became more and more. To keep up with the trend, I decided to create a few key functional pieces in my home that could help me get more done. Here are some tips on how to make your home more functional: 
1. Make an organized space - One of the most important things you can do to improve your productivity is make sure you have an organized space in which to work. This can be anything from a shelves of books on one side of the room to wires leading out of the windows for potential cable management purposes. 

2. Get rid of distractions - When it comes to working, it’s important to keep things as quiet and distraction-free as possible.

What are some creative methods?
Creative methods can be anything from painting to sculpting, but they all have one common goal: to help you achieve your creative goals. Here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Get organized: When it comes to creative endeavors, organization is key. Not only will this help you keep track of what you’re working on, but it can also inspire you to come up with new ideas. Try keeping a binder or portfolio around with all of your creative works, as well as any sketches, paintings, or sculptures that you may have created in the past. 
2. Draw inspiration from nature: One of the best ways to get inspired by your work is to draw inspiration from nature. Not only will this give you a strong grounding in composition and color, but it can also provide inspiration for new ideas and concepts.
