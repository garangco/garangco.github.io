Economic Applications of Invention
Invention has a broad range of economic applications, from making new products to improving the efficiency of businesses. Inventions can also have a significant impact on the economy as a whole, depending on their potential uses and impacts. Here are some examples: 
1. Invention can help improve the quality of products. For example, an invention that makes products more healthy or less risky could lead to increased sales and reduce risks associated with manufacturing processes. 
2. Invention can help increase efficiency in businesses. For example, an invention that makes it easier to track expenses or get information from suppliers could lead to faster delivery times and reduced costs for businesses. 
3. Invention can create new markets for products or services. For example, an invention that creates a new type of clothing could bring in new customers and make it more difficult for rivals to compete against him/her.

The future of work: What will society be like without jobs?
In 2020, many people are likely to believe that the future of work is one where machines take over most tasks. This is due to the mounting evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more advanced, and will soon be able to outperform humans in many tasks. With so much automation happening, it's no wonder that companies are looking for ways to keep employees on board with the idea of AI taking over work. Some companies are already using AI tools to help employees learn new skills and knowledge, while others are using it as a way to outsource certain jobs or reduce costs. Whatever the case may be, the future of work looks bleak without jobs.
