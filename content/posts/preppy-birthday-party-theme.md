The Aftermath of Creativity: What happens to creativity after itâ€™s completed?
Creativity is a natural and essential part of many people s lives. It can be used to create new ideas, or to explore old ones. But what happens to creativity once it s completed?

If they haven t, they may not have been able to improve their ideas or come up with new ways to approach problems. The second factor is the intensity of the creative process itself. If it s gentle, nurturing, and doesn t require any hard work or effort on the part of the creator, then they may be more likely to maintain their creative Passions for life. But if the creative process is strenuous and demanding, then they may not be as inspired again as soon as they once were.
