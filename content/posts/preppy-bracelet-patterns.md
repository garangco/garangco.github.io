Conclusion: What is creativity? What differentiates it from other abilities and how can it be used to create successful outcomes?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, formulations and plans that are not always easy to come by. Itâ€™s a process that starts with the brainstorming session and continues until the final product is created. It can be used for good or bad outcomes, but creativity has a key advantage; it allows individuals to take risks and think outside the box.

What are its benefits?
A study by Dr. David Levy and colleagues at the University of Montreal has shown that brainstroming can improve creativity. The effect is even stronger when participants are working on a problem that they are really passionate about. Brainstroming allows people to focus on one task for a sustained period of time, making them more creative in their thoughts and ideas.
