New ideas and how to find them: What factors do you need to consider?
Are you looking for new ideas to improve your business? If so, there are a few things you need to consider. Here are some factors to consider:
1) What is your target market? Are you targeting new customers or existing ones? 
2) What are your goals? Are you looking to grow or remain profitable? 
3) How can you reach your target market? Do you have a website or marketing strategy in place? 
4) How will your products and services meet the needs of your target market? Will you create a unique selling proposition or copy that stands out from the competition? 
5) Can you afford to wait until later in life to start expanding into new markets? Are there already established businesses in those markets that could use some help, or do you have the resources and experience necessary to take on such a venture right now?

Evaluation: What factors do you need to consider when evaluation your Ideas?
Creative ideas are a valuable component of any business. However, they can also be a challenge to evaluate and assess. There are many factors you need to consider when evaluating your creative ideas. 
One important factor is the quality of your idea. If your idea is low quality, it will likely not be accepted by potential customers or partners. You must also consider the feasibility of your idea- does it actually have a chance of happening? If not, you may need to rethink your pitch and make sure the idea has enough potential to overcome any challenges. Additionally, you should measure the impact of your idea- is it worth risking money and time just to bring it to life? Finally, you must determine whether or not people will actually use your idea- is it something that people would want in their business? If not, you may need to revise or remove its from consideration.

creating: How do you create ideas?
Creative ideas are a key part of any successful business. By understanding how to create and use creative ideas, you can improve your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Come up with a specific idea. One of the most important things to do when creating creative ideas is to come up with a specific goal that you want to achieve. This will help you focus on what needs to be done instead of thinking about every possible option.

2. Look for inspiration. When looking for inspiration, don’t just look at things that have already been done or that have been popular in the past. Check out those that have gone above and beyond in order to get an idea of what you could do yourself (and make sure you avoid copying anyone!).

3. Be flexible.
