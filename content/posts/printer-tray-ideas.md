Patent applications: How do you apply for a patent?
When you come up with an invention, the easiest way to protect it is to apply for a patent. Patent applications are filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In order to be considered for a patent, your invention must meet certain requirements, including: 
-Your invention must be new and not using copyrighted material
-Your invention must be on a subject that is currently being used in commerce or in the development of a product
-Your invention must have a clear and novel idea that can be patented
-Your Invention should be based on an existing product or service There are several ways to file for a patent, but many people start by submitting their idea to a competition or through their professional Labs. The USPTO has many resources available online so you can get started.

There are many ideas for the 2022 FIFA World Cup that have been circulating throughout the internet and among football journalists. One idea is to have a knockout tournament where the top finishers in each group would play off in a semifinal series. Another idea is to add a new rule that allows teams to substitution during matches, which would give players more time to rest. Another idea is to change the name of the competition from the "FIFA World Cup" to the "World Cup for Nations".
