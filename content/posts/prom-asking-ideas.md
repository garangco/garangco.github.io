Ideas for social media: How can we promote our products and services?
Are you looking to develop social media platforms that can help promote your products and services? Here are a few ideas for how to go about it. 
1. Start by creating a social media profile for your business. This can include a username, website, and phone number. Make sure to have a strong presence on all types of social media platforms, as this will be your main source of marketing reach. 
2. Use influencer marketing techniques to reach more people on social media. If you have an existing following of popular bloggers or other influential individuals, reach out and ask them to endorse your product or service on their blog or other online outlet. This will allow you to build trust with potential customers and increase the likelihood theyâ€™ll visit your website or give you feedback. 
3. Join relevant communities and forums relevant to your industry or target market.

Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.

The Three Types of Ideas: What are they and how should you use them?
Ideas are a type of ammunition that can be used to improve a person's productivity, creativity and overall outlook. There are three main types of ideas: operational, problem-solving and innovative.
Operational ideas involve tasks that can be completed quickly and easily. These include things like fixing a car or getting the cat out of the dog's toy box. Problem-solving ideas involve taking several steps in order to find a solution to a problem. These include solving an equation for example, or figuring out how to make something work better. Inventive ideas involve coming up with new ways to do something, or finding an old way of doing something and adapting it to new circumstances.
