What are some bad ideas?
The following are some bad ideas that people come up with all the time. Some of these ideas are really stupid and not good for anything, but they get thrown around a lot and people think they might be good. So, here are some of the worst ideas:
1) Making cars into machines. This is a really bad idea because it will make the cars more efficient and faster, but it will also make them more expensive to maintain.
2) Giving away free stuff. This is another bad idea because it won’t help anyone and it’s going to make people less likely to buy things.
3) Creating welfare programs that only benefit the wealthy. This would be a really bad idea because it would create a lot of competition among businesses and it would drive up prices for goods and services.
4) making school harder than necessary.

How to get started: What should you do before starting any creative project?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any creative project. Before starting any creative project, it's important to have a grasp of what you want to create. There are many different ways to get started, but some things you should keep in mind before starting any creative project: 1) Know your target audience. What do you want your project to achieve? Are you looking to generate new ideas for clients or sell products? Knowing the target audience is key in getting started. 2) Be prepared for failure.
