This can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which can in turn hinder productivity. It is important to remember that not everything needs to be done at once, and taking a step back can help clear your head and get back on track.

It is important to stay focused on the task at hand and set achievable goals rather than worrying about anything else outside of the task at hand.
