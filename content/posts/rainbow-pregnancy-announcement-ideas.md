Defining creativity
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it’s about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

But despite the difficulty in defining it, there are some commonalities that all definitions of creativity share. Creativity is often seen as a process of turning something ordinary into something extraordinary. It’s about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.

Ideas for creativity: What are some examples?
Creativity is often thought of as a source of inspiration and a way to come up with new ideas. However, creative ideas can also be generated through creativity itself. Here are some examples: 
1. Thinking outside the box – When you come up with new ideas, it’s important not to be afraid to be creative. This can mean thinking about things that you’ve never thought of before or coming up with ways to improve upon what others have already done. 
2. Taking risks – If you’re looking for new ways to get your creative juices flowing, always take some risks. This means trying out different concepts or concepts that you might not have considered before. It can also involve taking on tasks that are too much for you to complete easily or challenging yourself in order to force yourself to think outside the box and come up with new ideas.
