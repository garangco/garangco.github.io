Brainstroming is a new way of thinking that promises to change the way we think about intelligence and creativity. It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills.

How can you get creative and come up with new ideas?
Creativity is key to any success. If you can come up with new ideas, you’ll be on your way to becoming a more successful person. It’s not hard to come up with new ideas when you think about it. Just keep your mind open and don’t be afraid to try something new. Here are three tips for getting creative:
1. Start with small tasks. When you have some creativity going for you, it’s easier to get started on bigger projects. Try coming up with a few different ideas for a project and see which ones sound best before jumping into the full-blown creation process.

2. Take time with your ideas. Once you have your brainstorming materials, it’s important to take some time to really think about what you want your idea to say or do.

The Future of Education: What will be the future of education?
The future of education is a question that has been asked for centuries and will continue to be asked in the coming years. Many different ideas have been proposed as to what the future of education should be, but no one single answer has emerged as the definitive answer. Some possible answers include: 
"Equality of opportunity" 
"Universal Basic Education" 
"Teacher training programs for all skill levels" 
" computer-assisted learning "
In terms of ideas, the most likely answer would be a form of universal basic education. This would provide all citizens with equal access to education, regardless of their economic status or educational qualifications. Another idea that has been proposed is teacher training programs for all skill levels. This would allow people of all skill levels to learn how to teach, which would then help reduce teaching costs and improve overall school quality.
