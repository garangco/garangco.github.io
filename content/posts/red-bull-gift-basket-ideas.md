What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are different things for every person, but they can be some of the most important things in a person's life. Whether you're trying to come up with new ways to do something or just needing a new idea to get you started, creative ideas are always a good source of inspiration. Here are 8 ideas to get you started: 
1. Come up with new ways to use old materials.
2. Think outside the box and come up with new solutions for problems you've never seen before.
3. Be innovative and take risks with your ideas.
4. Be persistent and keep trying until you find the right solution. 
5. Get help from others if you need it – whether that's from friends, family, or a professional help desk staffer.

Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.
