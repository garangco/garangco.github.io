what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.
