The future of work
The future of work is anything but clear. Some experts believe that the internet will eventually disappear and that people will must rely on traditional methods of working, such as jobs in factories or offices. Others think that artificial intelligence and other technologies will soon make it possible for people to work from home, receive health benefits, and even become self-employed. While there are many potential outcomes to what the future of work may hold, it is important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. What works for one person may not work for another. So how can we create a future where both workers and businesses are satisfied?
