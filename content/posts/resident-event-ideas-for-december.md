What are the benefits of big ideas?
There are many benefits to big ideas, including increased creativity, innovation, and productivity. However, there are also a few key considerations that should be taken into account when creating big ideas. Here are four tips to help you create better big ideas:
1. Be clear and concise: The more information you can provide in a clear and concise manner, the easier it will be for others to understand your concept and develop a plan for implementing it.

2. Be realistic: Always be honest with your expectations and goals when developing big ideas. Don’t try to “solve everything” – instead focus on areas that can be quickly improved or neglected.

The value of feedback: How important is it to get feedback on ideas before they are implemented?
Feedback is an important part of any business. It can help you make sure your ideas are a good fit for the company, and it can help you improve your products or services. But getting feedback on ideas before they're implemented can be just as important. If you don't get feedback, you could end up implementing something that's not really what you wanted or was hoping for. Feedback can also help you learn how to improve your business model and improve the way your products and services are delivered. It's worth getting it, whether it's through surveys or informal conversations with employees.
