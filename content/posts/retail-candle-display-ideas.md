How do you come up with good ideas?
Ideas are a dime a dozen, but they often have the potential to be great. Here are three tips to come up with good ideas:
1. Take your time – don’t just give up on an idea right away. Start by thinking about it more closely and then coming up with potential ways that it could be improved.

2. Be open to feedback – If you don’t think your idea is good, ask other people for their opinions. This will help you get closer to the best version of your idea.

3. Be persistent – If you keep working on your idea, eventually it will become better.

Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to new ways of doing the same thing, but they always have to have a purpose. In the world of creative ideas, there are endless possibilities, but sometimes the best ones just don't work out. That's why it's important to have a clear idea of what you want your creative project to achieve. If you can't specify what you want it to achieve, your project might not be successful.
