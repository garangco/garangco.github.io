Why should people care about it?
There are many reasons why people should care about climate change, but some of the most pressing ones include: increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events; loss of life due to climate-related disasters; and the high cost of inaction.
One way to help mitigate climate change is by using technology to create more accurate predictions of future weather patterns, as well as developing more efficient energy systems. Other ways to make a significant impact on mitigating the effects of climate change include: investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro; cleaning up our water resources so that they can provide clean drinking water for everyone; improving transportation options so people can access clean energy when they need it; and reducing emissions from industry and homes.

Definition of invention:
Invention definitions vary by country, so it's important to define what an invention is before discussing it in further detail. In the United States, for example, an invention is a new product or service that has never been produced before. Inventions can be made from anything from scratch, to a variation on existing technology. They can even come from ideas someone had while brainstorming during their day job.
There are many different ways to define Invention when discussing it with others. However, the most common definition of an invention is something that has never been done before. This definition can be used to describe any new product or service you may come up with. If you're thinking of creating a new idea for a product or service, you might want to try and come up with a definition of Invention first to get started.
