Trends in artificial intelligence (AI): What new sources of AI will we see in the next few years?
AI is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily lives, with a number of startups and companies working on various AI projects. Some of the most important trends that are expected to take place in the next few years include:
1. More automated intelligent agents – This trend is already being seen in some industries, such as retail, where machines are increasingly able to carry out tasks that used to be carried out by human beings. The hope is that this will eventually lead to increased efficiency and savings for businesses.

2. Machine learning – This field is rapidly developing and has the potential to change many aspects of our lives, from business to healthcare. It involves building algorithms that can learn from data and make decisions on their own. This could lead to huge improvements in our understanding of the world around us, as well as new ways of detecting and responding to dangerous situations.

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.
