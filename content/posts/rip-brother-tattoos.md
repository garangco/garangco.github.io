The Importance of Commercializing Your Invention
Invention ideas are the lifeblood of the modern economy. They are the source of all new products and services, and they drive economic growth. Without them, we would be stuck in a world of old, outdated products and technologies.
So why is it so important to commercialize your invention idea? There are several reasons:

1. To make money: Obviously, this is the main reason why people commercialize their invention ideas. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, you can make a lot of money by bringing it to market.

2. To change the world: Invention ideas have the potential to change the world for the better. By commercializing your idea, you can bring your vision to reality and make a positive impact on society.

What are some common problems that come with big ideas?
There are a number of common problems that come with big ideas, including: 1) not knowing how to conceptualize and execute them; 2) not knowing what to do with positive feedback when it's available; and 3) not being able to focus on the bigger picture. If you're struggling with any of these issues, here are some tips to help you overcome them: 
1) Draw on your own personal experience or experiences from others in order to understand what works for them. This will help you gain a better understanding of how your idea can be executed. 
2) Take a step back and analyze your idea in terms of its overall goal rather than just individual goals. This will help you figure out whether or not it's worth pursuing. 
3) Don't be afraid to ask for help when it comes time to execute your idea.
