Overcoming obstacles: Discuss the challenges that inventors face and how they overcome them.
Invention is the process of coming up with an idea and turning it into a reality. It is a process that takes time, effort, and determination. Inventors often face many obstacles along the way, but they overcome them by being persistent and finding creative solutions.
One of the biggest challenges that inventors face is funding. Turning an idea into a reality can be expensive, and many inventors don’t have the money to do it on their own. They may need to find investors or take out loans to finance their invention.

Another obstacle that inventors face is making sure their invention is unique. There are already so many products on the market, and it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd. Inventors need to do their research and make sure their product is filling a need that isn’t being met by existing products.
