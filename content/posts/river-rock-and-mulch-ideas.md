Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples:

You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors.
