Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.
