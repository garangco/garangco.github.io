Introduce the topic of invention ideas
Most people never think about invention ideas until they see a commercial for a new product on television. Even then, the average person rarely stops to think about how that product was created or what it took to bring it to market. The process of invention is one that takes a lot of time, energy and dedication. Inventors are some of the most creative people in the world. They look at the world around them and see problems that need to be solved.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes inventors are inspired by nature, other times they see a problem and work to find a solution. There are also times when an inventor comes up with an idea for a product that is completely new and unique. No matter where the idea comes from, all inventions start with an idea.

The first step in turning an idea into an invention is doing some research.

The power of creativity: What does it mean for your business?
Creativity is a key factor in any business, and it can mean the difference between success and failure. Whether you’re working on a project or just thinking out loud, creativity can help you come up with innovative solutions that solve problems. But what does it really mean for your business? Here are six things to keep in mind when looking to embrace creativity: 1. It can help you attract new customers. When people feel inspired by your work, they’re more likely to invest in your product or service. 2. It can increase productivity. Having fresh ideas on how to improve your business process can lead to faster and more efficient progress. 3. It can help you build relationships with customers. By being open and sharing your ideas, you risk losing customers who are already loyal to your competitor. 4. It can help you shift focus from results to customer satisfaction.
