Creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative processes can vary in their specifics, but all involve the creative process of coming up with ideas, narrowing them down to a few that work well, and then implementing those ideas into a tangible form. Here are three examples of creative processes: 
1. Brainstorming: brainstorming is when people come up with new ideas without any specific constraints. This can be done in private or in group settings, and it's often used to come up with new ways to do something or improve on an existing product. 
2. Design: design is when a product or idea is created from scratch. It starts with the idea and then goes through various stages, including development, testing, and production. 
3. Programming: programming is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem or comes up with a new way to do something.

Overcoming the challenges of bringing a big idea to life
There are many challenges that come with bringing a big idea to life. The first challenge is often just getting started. It can be difficult to take that first step, but it's important to remember that every journey begins with a single step. Once you've taken that first step, the next challenge is often keeping your motivation high. It's easy to get discouraged when you encounter setbacks, but it's important to keep your eye on the prize and remember why you're doing this in the first place. Finally, another common challenge is maintaining momentum. It can be difficult to keep moving forward when you're feeling bogged down or burned out, but it's important to push through and keep your energy up. These are just some of the challenges you may face when bringing a big idea to life, but if you stay focused and committed, you can overcome them and achieve your goals.
