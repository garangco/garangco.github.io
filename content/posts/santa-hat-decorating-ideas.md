Conclusion: What are some ideas for inventions?
Ideas for inventions can come in many forms. Sometimes, an invention is a new way of doing something, like the wheel. Other times, an inventor may come up with a new product, like the iPhone. Whatever the form, there are certain things that must be included in order to make an invention work. These things include creativity, innovation, and feasibility. 
Creativity is important when it comes to Invention ideas. For example, think about how you could come up with a new way to market a product or sell a service. Innovation is key when it comes to Invention ideas as well. If someone has come up with a good idea before but hasn’t been implemented successfully, they can often improve on their design or implementation by coming up with another variation or idea that works better.
