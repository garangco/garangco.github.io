How can we turn big ideas into reality?
How can we turn big ideas into reality? There is no one answer to this question, as the process of turning big ideas into real world solutions will vary depending on the individual and organization. However, some tips on how to make this happen include:
1) Taking the time to think through and come up with a good idea. This means taking the time to think about what could be done, and not just what you’re thinking right now. It can be helpful to have a goal in mind before starting any project, so that you know you won’t get sidetracked.

2) being clear about what you want. Once you have a good idea of what you want, it's important to be sure that everyone involved knows what they need to do in order for that idea to become a reality.

Business: How do you make money from invention ideas?
If you're an inventor, there are a few things you need to keep in mind if you want to make some money from your invention ideas. 
First, it's important to come up with interesting and novel ideas that have potential market value. In order to get your idea accepted by the public, you'll need to supply clear evidence that your product or service is better than the competition.

Second, do your research before starting a business. Make sure you understand what kind of expenses associated with developing and selling your product or service and how much money you'll actually be making from each sale.

Finally, be prepared for long hours and plenty of travel (especially if your idea involves selling products or services online). This isn't easy work - but it's definitely worth it when it comes to making money from your invention ideas!
