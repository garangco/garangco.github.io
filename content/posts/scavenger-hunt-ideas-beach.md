The definition of creativity
What is creativity? Many people have different definitions for creativity. Some say that it is when you come up with new and original ideas, while others define it as the ability to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to generate new and innovative ideas. It is often seen as a process of problem solving, where you take existing knowledge and use it in new and unique ways. Creativity is often associated with artistry and design, but it can also be found in other areas such as business, science, and technology.

There are many ways to encourage creativity. One way is to provide opportunities for people to work on creative projects together. This can help them to come up with new ideas and solutions by bouncing ideas off of each other.
