The brainstroming effect is a phenomenon which occurs when two or more people are working on the same task and their brains are engaged in a communication battle. The winner is the one that manages to get the most information into their brain before the other person does. Brainstroming can be harnessed for various purposes, such as improving performance at work or school, making better decisions, and increasing productivity.
