What are the new ideas?
It is no secret that the world is changing, and that this change is happening in many different ways. Some of the most recent changes include the rise of technology, which has led to a new level of accessibility for people with disabilities. Other changes include the shifting sands of geopolitics, which have led to a more complex world order. And yet still others can be seen in shifts in social norms and behaviors, as people become more open to different ideas and lifestyles.
One important concept that has been growing in prominence over the past few years is inclusion. This concept has been barrinated by a number of events, from #MeToo to the Parkland shooting, that have raised awareness and asked society how it can embrace diversity while protecting safety and civil rights. Inclusion means understanding and accepting different perspectives, cultures, and religions while also considering each person’s unique needs.

Inventors and their inventions
Inventors are people who create something new that has never been seen before. They come up with an idea, and then turn that idea into a reality. Inventions can be anything from a simple tool to a life-saving medical device.
Some of the most famous inventors in history are Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, and the Wright brothers. Da Vinci was an artist and scientist who invented many things, including the helicopter and the tank. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb and the phonograph. The Wright brothers invented the airplane.

Inventors make our world a better place. They help us solve problems and make everyday tasks easier. We owe a lot to these creative thinkers!
