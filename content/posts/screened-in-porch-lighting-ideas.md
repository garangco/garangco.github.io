Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They can be inspiration or a way to take the next step. Here are three ways to overcome them:
1) Take a break: When it feels like you can't get started, take a break and come back with fresh eyes. With enough time, your new ideas will start to form and you'll be on your way to creating something great.
