Conclusion: the benefits of creative art
Creative art is often thought of as a luxury, something that only the wealthy can afford to enjoy. However, the benefits of creative art are not just financial; they are also emotional and mental.
Creative art can help people to express themselves in ways that they may not be able to do with words. It can also be a way to release bottled-up emotions and feelings. For some people, creative art is a form of therapy that helps them to deal with difficult life events or traumas.

The benefits of creative art go beyond the individual. When people create art together, it can help to build bridges between cultures and communities. It can also be used as a tool for social change, raising awareness about important issues such as environmentalism or human rights.

What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

creating a plan: What steps should you take to create a plan for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that you want them to be, but there are a few key steps you should take in order to create a plan for your creative ideas. First, identify what kind of ideas you want to pursue. Once you have a solid idea of what you want to create, it’s time to start thinking about how you will go about pursuing those ideas. 
Next, think about the resources you will need in order to pursue your creative ideas. What tools and equipment do you need in order to begin working on your projects? If you don’t have any tools or equipment, it’s important to find someone who does and ask them for help. Once you have the basics set up, it’s time to start thinking about the deadline that you will be wanting your project done by.
