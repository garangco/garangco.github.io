What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas, products, or services that are different from what is already out there. It can also be seen as the change that occurs in the way we use and think about things. Innovation is often seen as something good, like new ways to make our food or clothes. However, sometimes innovation can also be bad, like a new way of advertising that isn't effective.

Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.
