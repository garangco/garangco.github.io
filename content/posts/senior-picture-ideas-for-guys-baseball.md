Inventions are often the products of individuals who come up with an idea for a new product or service, and then go on to make it a reality. Some famous inventions include the transistor, the Apollo 11 moon landing, and the iPhone. The list goes on and on, but it is important to think about what made some of these inventions successful – from the innovative design to the marketing that helped them sell out. Here are six examples of successful inventions that you may have never heard of:
