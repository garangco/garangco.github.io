The challenge of innovation: What are the challenges associated with innovative thinking?
Invention ideas are at the heart of most businesses and economies. They can provide new products or services that improve how people live, work, and play. But innovation can be a challenge, as it often requires fresh thinking and new ways of looking at old ideas. Here are some challenges associated with innovative thinking:
1) Finding the right balance – trying too hard to be different can backfire, leading to stagnation or even failure.

3) Working with others – collaborating with other teams and individuals can help speed up the process and create a more cohesive group.

4) Creating value – creating new products or services that offer value for customers is one of the most difficult aspects of innovation.
