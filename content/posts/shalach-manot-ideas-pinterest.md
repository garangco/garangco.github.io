Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.

The Benefits of Creative Ideas: After hearing all of the benefits of creative ideas, it is clear why they are so important in business.
Creative ideas are important in business because they can help businesses create new and innovative products or services. Some of the benefits of creative ideas include: 
1. Increased Productivity – When a business has a good idea, they can often improve their productivity as they can better focus on what they are supposed to be doing. 
2. Improved Delight at Work – While some businesses may find it difficult to come up with creative ideas, creative thinking often leads to increased delight and satisfaction with work. This is due in part to the fact that creativity opens up new possibilities and helps businesses explore the potential of their products or services in a more interesting way than if they were just following pre-determined paths.
