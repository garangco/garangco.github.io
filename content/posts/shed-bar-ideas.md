Defining creativity
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it’s about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

But despite the difficulty in defining it, there are some commonalities that all definitions of creativity share. Creativity is often seen as a process of turning something ordinary into something extraordinary. It’s about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.

When it comes to having ideas, sometimes the hardest part is getting started. This is where brainstorming comes in. Brainstorming is a process that allows you to generate ideas by putting all of your thoughts down on paper (or in a computer document). The goal of brainstorming is to come up with as many ideas as possible, without worrying about whether or not they are good ideas.

Ideas are the cornerstone of progress
Ideas are the cornerstone of progress. They allow us to see the world in new ways and to find solutions to problems that have seemed insurmountable.
Ideas give us hope that we can make the world a better place. They inspire us to take action and to work towards our goals.

Without ideas, we would be stuck in the same old patterns, never making any real progress. So let's celebrate our ideas, and let's use them to make the world a better place for everyone.
