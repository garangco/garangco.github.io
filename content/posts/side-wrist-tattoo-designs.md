Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:
1) The first electronic device was created in 1861 by George Stephenson and James Clerk Maxwell. This was known as the Manchester Electrician's Watch. It was used to tell time and helped people stay healthy during health epidemics like bubonic plague.

2) Invention of combustion engine in 1879 by John Fenton and Arthur Couch. This allowed cars to be driven on paved roads instead of being pulled by horses or carts.

How to start a blog?
If you're looking for ways to start a blog, here are some ideas to get you started. First, consider what kind of content you'd like to create. If you want to share thoughts on your work or politics, then your blog would be focused around that topic. If you want to write about life in general, maybe something like “How I Found My Love for Painting” might be more interesting. Once you have a focus, though, there are a few things to keep in mind when starting a blog. First, make sure your blog is easy to navigate and find. You don't want people trying to find your site by accident while they're browsing the internet; make sure your site is well-marked and easy to navigate. Second, make sure your content is high quality. No one wants to read an article that's full of errors or sparse information.
