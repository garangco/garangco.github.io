How to Go about Gathering Ideas: How do you go about gathering them?
It can be tough to come up with ideas, especially when you don't know what you're looking for. However, there are a few things that can help. One is to think about the problem that you want to solve. Something that may help is brainstorming, which can be done by taking a walk or sitting down and thinking about everything that comes to your mind. Then, try coming up with several potential solutions. Another thing to consider is who you want to speak to. You might want someone who knows the industry well or someone who can give you an outsider's perspective on what's going on. Finally, make sure that you have something tangible in mind before starting any brainstorming process. This could be anything from ideas for products or services to pictures or examples of how things might work in practice.

If you're like most people, wrapping up your DIY projects is a key part of the success of completing them. Here are some tips to help make it a breeze:
1) Shred or cut everything before you start. This will help keep things organized and make it easier to wrap up.
2) Take your time. Do your project one step at a time and be patient. You'll be glad you did!
3) Get organized. Make a plan and stick to it. This will help keep everything under control and make the wrapping process easier.
4) Label everything! Not only will this help when wrapping up, but it will also remind you what's what when it comes time to move on to the next project.
