In 2020, the world was introduced to a new type of economy dubbed 'ideas 2022'. This new economy is based on the idea that everyone should have access to ideas, and that this should be done through a free and open market. The main innovation in this economy is the ability for businesses to patent their ideas, which will give them an exclusive right to use the idea for an unlimited period of time.

Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!

How can an invention idea be put into practice?
Invention ideas are aplenty, but there are a few key things that have to be in place for an idea to take hold and become a reality. The first is that the invention idea must be unique and not already taken by someone else. Additionally, the idea must be feasible to produce and/or create a tangible benefit. Lastly, the innovation should be something that can improve society as a whole.
