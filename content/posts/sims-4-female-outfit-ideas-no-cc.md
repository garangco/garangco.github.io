What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.

How to develop big ideas
The art of big ideas is key to any business. The ability to come up with original and exciting concepts that can help your company grow is what makes the business world so fascinating. Here are a few tips on how to develop big ideas:
1. Don’t be afraid to ask for help – There’s no shame in asking for help from outside of your company if you don’t have an idea that seems impossible. If you have a great idea, but don’t know where to start, speak with friends, family, or colleagues about your idea. They may have some great advice on how to get started.

2. Get organized – Once you have a good idea, it helps to organize it in some way so that you can better focus on developing it.

what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas or solutions. It is often used in a group setting, but can also be done alone. Brainstorming involves generating a list of ideas and then evaluating them to see which are the best.
There are a few different techniques that can be used when brainstorming. One is called free association, which is when you come up with ideas without censoring yourself. This can help you to come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Another technique is called mind mapping, which is when you create a visual representation of your thoughts. This can help you to see the connections between different ideas and to better organize your thoughts.

Brainstorming can be a helpful way to generate new ideas or solutions to problems.
