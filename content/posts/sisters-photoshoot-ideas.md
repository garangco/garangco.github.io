Conclusion: What are some big ideas that you came up with and how did they play out in practice?
The big ideas that were used in practice for the Vikings game on Thursday night were running back Adrian Peterson and tight end Kyle Rudolph. Peterson ran for 124 yards on 14 carries and Rudolph caught a pass for 79 yards. This showed that it is possible to run the ball effectively and have success with tight ends. These results show that big ideas can work if put into practice.
