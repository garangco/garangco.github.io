Tips for starting a DIY project: What do you need before beginning?
There are a few things you need before beginning your DIY project. These include a level, a hammer, screws, nails, and an armoire. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Level the surface area of the work surface to ensure accuracy.
2. Choose a Hammer that is the Right Size for Your Project. A larger hammer will be more powerful and will take more time to smooth out the surface of the wood. A smaller hammer may have better speed but will leave more marks on the wood.
3. Nail The Work Surface To The Wall or Floor First. This will prevent mess and make it easier to handle your project later on when nails are needed.
4. Screw The Work Surface To The wall or Floor After You nail it down (If using a floor).

Trends for Work/Life Balance
In the next few years, many people are looking for ways to balance work and personal lives. Here are some ideas for ways to make work life easier for everyone: 1. Make work a non-essential part of your day. This means that you should only be working when it is necessary and from what you are best suited for. If you have time off during the week, use it to take care of yourself or do something that you enjoy. 2. Try using technology instead of avoiding it. Technology can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it also can keep you from getting too involved with work. Make sure to set boundaries so that your time on the computer is only used for necessary tasks and not idle chat or gaming. 3. Find a job that fit both your skills and interests.

Exercise: How to be creative in your everyday life
Creativity is a key word in everyone’s vocabulary. Whether you are a creative artist, graphic designer, or just someone who enjoys making things, creativity is important to have in your everyday life. There are so many ways to be creative and put your creativity into use every day- from taking risks with new ideas to using your creativity to solve problems. Here are five tips on how you can become more creative in your everyday life: 
1. Take risks: If you are afraid of anything, it will limit your creativity. Be brave and try something new- it might not work out, but at least you will have tried and that will help you learn more about yourself and what makes you feel successful. 
2. Use your imagination: The more fun you can have when thinking about ideas, the more likely you will be to come up with new ones.
