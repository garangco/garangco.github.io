Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.

How could we change the world if we only thought about what was best for ourselves? What if we started thinking about the greater good? This is a question that has been on the mind of many people over the past few years, but it has received little attention. The problem is that most decisions made by humans are based on self-interest and convenience. We often forget that there is a greater good at stake when making decisions, and it’s time for us to start considering this in our everyday lives.
