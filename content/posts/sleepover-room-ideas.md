Development: How do you actually develop an invention idea?
When it comes to developing an invention idea, the best way is to do some research and figure out what you want to create. If you have a specific problem that you want to solve, then brainstorm a few possible solutions. However, if you don't know what you're looking for or if you just don't have any ideas, then brainstorming won't help. The best way to come up with an invention idea is by doing some tinkering and experimenting. Once you've had a few prototypes created, it's time to start turning them into a product. By doing this, you'll be able to see how people use your product and see where potential problems might exist.

Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They're the ones that push the envelope, inspire and drive innovation, and give founders a new way to think about their business. But when it comes to big ideas, there's one key rule that startups must follow: always have more than one. A single idea can be limiting, especially if it's based on an old model or a preconceived notion.
