Development and commercialization: How do you make money from your invention?
Invention ideas are all around us. Whether it's a new product or an idea for a new company, something can be invented and made into a business. There are many ways to monetize an invention, but there is one way that is always popular and payout: profit sharing. Profit sharing is when an inventor gets a percentage of the sales generated from their invention. It can be a great way to make some extra money while your invention remains in the public domain. There are different types of profit sharing, but one of the most common is share-the- wealth, which means that inventors receive a cut of any profits made by their invention. There are also royalty shares, which give inventors a share of the royalties received from selling their invention.
