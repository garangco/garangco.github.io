-Start by taking a look at what is already in your home and take down anything that isn't necessary. This will make room for new things and make your living space more organized.

-Create a basic organizational system for your home with drawers, shelves, boxes, and folders. You can use these to store clothes, tools, or other belongings.

-Expand the idea of organization by adding another level of complexity. For example, you could add removable dividers between rooms or add built-in shelving to main walls. This will give your living space more depth and organization without costing a lot of money.
