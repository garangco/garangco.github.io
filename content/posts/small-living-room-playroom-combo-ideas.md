Invention history: How did some inventions become successful?
Invention history is a long and flexible way to describe the process of creating something new. From the early days of mankind, when people were just starting to learn how to make things, Invention has always been an important part of human life. Sometimes, an idea can be very simple, and other times it may be more complex. But in both cases, it can bring about a lot of change and improvement for those who come up with it. Here are some examples of inventions that have made a big difference in the world:
1. The Telephone: This invention was actually two separate ideas – one by Alexander Graham Bell and the other by Samuel Morse. Both men were working on different projects at the time, but they came up with a working prototype together. In 1876, they announced their findings to the public and quickly became famous for their work.

Innovation in the global economy:
The global economy is constantly improving, with new and innovative technologies regularly coming onto the market. This increase in innovation has helped to drive down costs and increase efficiency, making life easier for consumers and businesses alike. However, as the global economy continues to grow, some challenges remain. One such challenge is that innovation often doesn't always trickle down to lower levels of society - in some cases, it can eveneaturedin the top tiers of businesses. This problem is called "inefficiency": When innovation takes place at a high level and benefits only a few people rather than everyone around them, it's often difficult for others to access or use the same ideas. Inefficiency can also lead to problems for the global environment - when businesses don't take into account environmental impact when making decisions about products or services, they can contribute to climate change.

The Benefits of New Ideas: What do they offer?
The benefits of new ideas are vast and range from more efficient ways to do things to new and innovative products that can change the way people live. Here are a few examples: 
1. New ideas can help you save time and money. If you can think of a way to make your work or home easier, you may be able to save time and money on tasks that you previously would have had to spend hours completing. 
2. New ideas can improve your creativity. When you come up with new ideas, it can be difficult not to come up with something that is both good and useful. By taking some time for yourself to come up with new ideas, you will be more likely to find something onerous or simply useless as well as something valuable that you could implement into your life immediately. 
3. New ideas can make life easier.
