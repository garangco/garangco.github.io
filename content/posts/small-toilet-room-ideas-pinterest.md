Conclusion: Some potential ideas that could be implemented in order to improve the current system.
One potential idea that could be implemented in order to improve the current system is an overhaul of the job listings process.

This could be changed so that only those who have had at least some college education are considered for a job, and those with higher qualifications are given a more chance to apply. Finally, there is the question of how to make sure that employees are happy and productive. Currently, many employees feel forced to work long hours for little pay, and sometimes don’t have enough opportunities for socialization.
