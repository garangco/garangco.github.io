What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.

Customer Loyalty: What is customer loyalty and how can it be increased in your business?
Customer loyalty is one of the most important aspects of a business. It is the basis for why people are customers and how they can be continued to be customers. Loyalty is increased when businesses provide value, implement change, and are responsive to customer needs. Here are three new ideas for increasing customer loyalty in your business:
1. Offer more value to customers: When you offer more value to customers, they will become more loyal. This can be done by adding features or services that are not currently available or by reducing prices. By doing this, you will create an emotional connection with your customers and increase their loyalty.

2. Change with the times: When you keep up with the latest trends in your industry, you will increase your chances of being a successful business.
