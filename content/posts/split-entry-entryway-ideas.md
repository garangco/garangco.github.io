Definition of creativity: What makes something creative?
Creativity is the ability of an individual to think outside the box and come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It can be found in any form, from creative writing to architectural design. To many, creativity is seen as a verb, meaning that someone does something creative in order to produce something new. However, for some, creativity stems from the act of thinking, rather than doing.

Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.
