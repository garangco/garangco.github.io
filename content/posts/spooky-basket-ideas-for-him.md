Definition of Invention: inventions are the results of creative thinking.
Invention is the result of creative thinking. This thinking can be done in a number of ways, but the most common way to come up with new ideas is through brainstorming. brainstorming is an informal process where people share their ideas with one another, without any specific goal in mind. By doing this, you can come up with a number of new ideas that could potentially be used in a product or service.
What makes brainstorming so helpful is that it allows for creativity to freely flow. When people areallowed to go at their own pace and have unrestricted access to their thoughts, they are more likely to come up with new and innovative solutions. This quality helps inventions become more effective and innovation becomes more commonplace.
