The Invention of the Electric Shock guitar
Electric shock guitars were invented in the late 1800s by George Lukacs, a musician and inventor. Lukacs had been playing an electric guitar that used alternating current (A.C.) to create sound, and he realized that electric guitars could be used for amplification. In 1892, Lukacs developed his first model electric guitar, the Electric Guitar Company's "Lukacs Guitars." The guitar was designed to be affordable and easy to play, with a single-coil pickup and a simple design. In 1934, Lukacs died at the age of 83, but his electric guitar remains one of the most significant instruments in history.

The Creative process: How do you go about creating creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a necessary part of any business. They can help businesses achieve their goals and increase profits. However, creating creative ideas isn't just easy; it takes time and effort. Here are four tips to help you go about creating creative ideas:
1. Take your time

One of the most important things to remember when creating creative ideas is that they should take a while to produce. This means that you should be patient in your pursuit of them. If you're not careful, your ideas may not come to fruition.

2. Be open to feedback

Another important thing to keep in mind when trying to create creative ideas is that there will always be someone who can offer valuable feedback. This means that you shouldn't shy away from seeking out advice or input from those who know more about your industry or product than you do.
