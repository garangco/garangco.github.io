creating: How do you create ideas?
Creative ideas are a key part of any successful business. By understanding how to create and use creative ideas, you can improve your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Come up with a specific idea. One of the most important things to do when creating creative ideas is to come up with a specific goal that you want to achieve. This will help you focus on what needs to be done instead of thinking about every possible option.

2. Look for inspiration. When looking for inspiration, don’t just look at things that have already been done or that have been popular in the past. Check out those that have gone above and beyond in order to get an idea of what you could do yourself (and make sure you avoid copying anyone!).

3. Be flexible.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of coming up with a new and original idea or approach to something. It can be anything from a new product or service to an innovative way of running a business. There are many types of innovation, but some are more popular than others. Here are four examples:
1. Creative invention – This type of innovation comes from coming up with an original solution to a problem that someone else had before you. This can be something as simple as creating a new type of bread recipe or developing a way to cut costs in your business.

2. Collective intelligence – This is when two or more people come up with an idea for solving a common problem and then work together to make it happen. This can be something as simple as coming up with a better way to stock shelves or finding new ways to sell products.
