What new trends will we see in technology in 2022?
1. In 2022, we will see a continued trend of technology that is more artificial intelligence-driven and able to learn on its own. This will allow machines to do things that humans would have traditionally considered difficult or impossible, such as understanding natural language and pattern recognition.
2. We also expect to see a continued move in the field of virtual reality, which has been growing in popularity in recent years due to its ability to immerses users into another world where they can experience the same sensations as if they were there. This technology could be used for training new employees or salespeople, or even for entertainment purposes.

3. Another trend we can expect to see in 2022 is the growth of self-driving cars, which are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and efficiency features.

Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.

Innovation is the process of coming up with new or innovative ways to do something. Sometimes, innovation is something that is seen as a backward step, but in reality it can be the key to a company’s success. Innovation can come from looking at things from a different perspective, or from finding new ways to do something. It can also come from taking risks and trying something new that might not be popular or successful before.
