What are the different ways to come up with ideas?
Let's face it, come up with ideas can be a challenge. But there are different ways to approach coming up with them. Here are three ways: 
1. Brainstorm with others: When you're stuck, brainstorm with other people to get their help. They might have a better idea than you do, and they might be more willing to share what they know.

2. Take a walk: Take a walk around your neighborhood or city to get new ideas for businesses or products. This can also lead you to places where you haven't thought of before.

3. Find an online course: If all else fails, take an online course on creativity in business or product design. This can help you learn how to come up with ideas from scratch and see how different techniques work in the real world.

What is the definition of big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be difficult to come by. There are a few things that make big ideas successful, and those things depend on the individual. Some people find it easy to come up with big ideas, while others may have to work hard to come up with them.
The most important thing is that big ideas should have a clear vision and purpose. They need to be interesting and useful, and they should be something that people can be excited about. Once they’re developed, big ideas need to be abandoned if they don’t meet these requirements.

If you want to find out what makes big ideas successful, you need to ask yourself a few questions. What are your goals? What does the audience want? What do you think will make the idea interesting and user-friendly? Are you worried about potential roadblocks or problems?
