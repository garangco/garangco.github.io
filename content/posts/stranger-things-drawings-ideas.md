Aims and objectives of creativity: What are they, and how do they differ from those of other art forms?
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas and concepts that are unrelated to what is currently on the surface. It can be found in all forms of art, but creativity in particular revolves around the idea of composition orlayout. In creative art, the aim is to create something that is unique and different from anything else in the world. Other forms of art may have specific objectives such as teaching or promoting a message, but creativity has no set boundaries.
