What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many to choose from. Here are a few that stand out to us:
-Start with what you know. What are your interests and passions? What do you like and don't like in the world around you? Start with that and work from there.

-Think outside the box. If you're not sure what to do, think about what other people have done or said that might be of interest to you. This can give you some great ideas for things to try or projects to take on.

The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.
