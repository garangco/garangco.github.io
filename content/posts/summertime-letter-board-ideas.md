The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.

Other Ideas: How do you go about thinking of other creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to improve the process of thinking. Here are a few tips on how to consider other creative ideas:
1. Look at your current work and ask yourself what you can improve. What are the areas that need improvement? How can you make those improvements?
2. Brainstorm with a group of people. When you come up with new ideas, it can be helpful to have others involved. Why not group together and brainstorm some potential solutions to problems you're currently facing? This will help you to formulate new ideas more effectively.
3. Take a step back and think about your goals. Once you've identified some areas that need improvement, what do you want to achieve with your change? What kind of results do you envision for your new efforts?
