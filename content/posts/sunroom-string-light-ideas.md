The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

How to Choose the rightDIY Project:
Choosing the right DIY project is important, especially if you want to create something for your own pleasure or use it as a learning opportunity. Here are four tips to help make the process easier:
1. Decide what you want your project to achieve. If you’re looking to make a simple change to your home or improve an existing piece of furniture, there are many possibilities out there. However, if you’re planning on creating something more comprehensive or complex, be sure to research the different types of dyes and materials before starting.

2. Consider your budget. Just because you can do something yourself doesn’t mean that it’s a good idea. Factor in both the cost of materials and the time it will take to complete your project.

Tips for Building a Better Home: How can you go about doing this?
One way to improve your home is by taking on some DIY projects. There are a variety of ways to go about this, so it really comes down to what you're interested in and what's available to you. Here are some tips for improving your home:
