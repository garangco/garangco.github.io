Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don’t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.

Inventors and their inventions
Inventors are people who create something new that has never been seen before. They come up with an idea, and then turn that idea into a reality. Inventions can be anything from a simple tool to a life-saving medical device.
Some of the most famous inventors in history are Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, and the Wright brothers. Da Vinci was an artist and scientist who invented many things, including the helicopter and the tank. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb and the phonograph. The Wright brothers invented the airplane.

Inventors make our world a better place. They help us solve problems and make everyday tasks easier. We owe a lot to these creative thinkers!

What are big ideas?
Some people might say that ideas are what make the world go round, and for some, big ideas are what get them up in the morning. Whatever your definition of big idea, there’s no doubt that it’s a powerful force in life. Here are five of our favorite big ideas: 
1. Start with one. This may seem like a ridiculously simple suggestion, but if you don’t have any big ideas to start with, you won’t be able to come up with anything great. After all, success isn’t about having a lot of small accomplishments; it’s about achieving great things starting small. 
2. Take things one step at a time.
