The steps: How do you complete a project?
If you're like most people, completing a project can feel like an annoying and frustrating ordeal. The good news is there are a few easy steps you can take to make the process less daunting. Here are some key tips to help you complete your projects quickly and efficiently:
1. Start with a goal. Once you have a rough idea of what you want to achieve, it's easier to organize your thoughts and start working on the project without any PRESSURE. Make sure your goal is clear from the get-go so that you don't end up frustrated when starting the project.

The power of big ideas
Big ideas are what drive innovation, creativity and success. They are the seeds of new thoughts and ideas that can change the course of a company or individual. Here, we explore four powerful ways to get big ideas in your head:
1. Get inspired by others: Take a look around you and see how others are able to come up with amazing solutions or new ideas. What do they do that you can't? Why did they do it that way and what were their results?

2. Adopt a principle: There's no need to be unique if you have a principle at the heart of your idea. Look for someone who has already done something great on this topic and copy their approach/methodology/mesurement/whatever it is.
