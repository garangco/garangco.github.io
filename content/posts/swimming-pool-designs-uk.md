Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.

The Future of Healthcare: How will we keep our citizens healthy?
As we work to look into the future of healthcare, we must consider many different ideas. One idea that we could consider is having a system where citizens can access health care on-demand. This would mean that patients and doctors would be able to talk with one another directly, and would not have to go through a bureaucracy. Another idea is having healthcare vouchers which could be used to pay for medical services out of pocket. This would help ensure that people are able to get the best care possible while staying healthy. Other ideas include increasing access to mental health services, ensuring that everyone has access to quality education, and creating more affordable healthcare options. All of these ideas are important in order to keep our citizens healthy and safe.
