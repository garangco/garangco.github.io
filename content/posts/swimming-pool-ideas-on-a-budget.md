Making your own home decor is a great way to update your look and feel without spending a fortune. Here are some easyDIY ideas that can give your home a new and unique appearance. 
1. Use old pieces of furniture as planks for the wall of your bedroom or office. This will add interest and character to the room while also being an efficient way to save space.

Commercializing an invention: What is the commercialization process?
Commercialization is the process of bringing an invention to market and making it available to the general public. There are a number of different commercialization processes that can be used to bring an invention to market. The most common process is license-back, in which the inventor and licensee agree on a royalty schedule and terms of use. License-back usually occurs when an invention is filed with the USPTO. License-backs are also common when a patent application is filed with the USPTO. Other commercialization processes include industriallicense, which involves selling rights to use an invention in a specific industry; technologylicense, which allows manufacturers or other businesses to use an invention in order to create products or services; and netpatent, which allows inventors to make money by selling patents they receive from others.
