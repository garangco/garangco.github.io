How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any successful career. If you can find ways to be more creative, your work will be more valuable and you'll be able to achieve your goals. Here are some tips on how to become more creative: 
1. Make time for yourself. When you're not working, take a break or do something that's outside of your regular routine. This will help you get away from the stress of the day and come back with fresh ideas. 
2. Take breaks when needed. When you're working hard, it's easy to get wrapped up in the task at hand and don't have time for anything else. However, when there's a break in between tasks, you can come back with new ideas and fresh perspective. 
3. Be open to change. Change is Key To Creative Processes!

The benefits of creative art: How does creativity benefit us?
Creativity has been shown to be beneficial in many ways, from helping people feel more creative and motivated, to improving our thinking and problem solving skills. However, there are also a number of other benefits that can come from creativity. Here are just a few: 
1. Increased understanding of complex topics. When people are able to understand complex concepts more clearly, they are better able to solve problems and make decisions. This is especially true when it comes to matters of the arts, as understanding how an image or painting is composed can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter at hand. 

2. Increased expression and communication. People who are more creative often have more natural communication abilities than those who aren’t. This is because creativity helps us express ourselves in a way that is both original and interesting.
