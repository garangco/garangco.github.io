What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everywhere, and it's hard to know where to start. Here are some ideas to get you started: 
-Start with what you know. What are some things that you enjoy doing or have a special interest in? Try thinking of ways to combine those hobbies with your creativity. 
-Explore new creative routes. Once you know some creative methods, start exploring different ways of doing things. What works for one artist might not work for another, but there is always room for growth. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is an idea to get started on something new. Experiment until you find something that works and then copy it!

The power of creative: why be creative?
Creativity is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. It allows us to see the world in new ways, to find solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable, and to connect with others in a deeper way.
Some people are naturally more creative than others, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of us can’t harness our own creativity. There are a number of things we can do to nurture our creativity, including:

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

- Take risks: Creativity often requires taking risks and thinking outside the box.

So why not give it a try?
