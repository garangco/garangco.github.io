patenting inventions: What is the process of getting an invention patent?
There is the process of patenting inventions, which can be a long and difficult process. Patent applications must be filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). After an application is filed, the USPTO will review it and may ask for changes or modifications. If approved, the application will then be sent to a full-blown prosecution process. This can take several months or even years. Once the full-blown prosecution process is complete, an invention may be registered with the USPTO as a trademark, trade name, or other intellectual property.

Origins of Invention: What inspired people to invent?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, method or product that has not been invented before. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to make bread dough, or developing a new agricultural technology. In some cases, Invention can even come from scratch – someone comes up with an idea for a product and starts production. There are many sources of Inspiration for Invention, and it can come from anywhere in the world.
There are several reasons why people might come up with an Invention. Sometimes people have an Idea because they are frustrated with their current situation, or they see an opportunity that they haven't seen before. Sometimes Invention comes about because of observing others in their environment and noticing how they solve problems.
