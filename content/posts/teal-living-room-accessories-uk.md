How can we create big ideas?
There are a lot of ways to create big ideas. You can think of big ideas as potential solutions to problems that you don't know how to solve. Ideas can come from anywhere, and you don't have to be creative or innovative to come up with them. What's important is that you have a good understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions you could consider. Here are some tips on how to generate big ideas:
1. Think about what people want or need. Once you know what people want or need, it's easier to start thinking about possible solutions that might address those needs.

2. Consider who your target market is.

What are some new ideas?
A recent report on the future of technology suggests that a number of new ideas are emerging for improving ways to connect people and create opportunities. One such idea is the use of robots to help with tasks that traditional humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as packaging goods, loading onto a truck, or cleaning. Another is the development of artificial intelligence (AI)powered assistants that can assist people with their day-to-day tasks, from booking appointments to grocery shopping. While these ideas may seem like small tweaks to existing workflows, they could have large implications for businesses and society as a whole.
