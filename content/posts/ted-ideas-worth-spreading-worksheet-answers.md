What are some tips for making big ideas a reality?
There are a few things you can do to help turn big ideas into reality. Here are some tips:
1. Make sure your idea is unique and interesting. Don’t just copy other people’s ideas – make sure you have your own approach that will stand out from the rest.

2. Get input from others – get feedback from people who have experience in the industry you’re thinking of entering. This will help you develop your idea further and come up with moreQaeda-friendly ideas.

3. Be persistent – if you don’t keep trying, eventually someone will come up with an idea that is similar to yours but has a bit more money or prestige attached to it. Keep at it, and eventually your idea will be accepted and turned into a reality!
