Summary: Why is it so important to have ideas? What are the benefits of using them, and what are some steps you can take to get started?
Ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous. If you don't have any, you'll be at a disadvantage in your competition. To have ideas is to be flexible and creative, but it's also to be open-minded and willing to change. There are a few key benefits of using ideas: 
1) You will be more prepared for anything that comes your way. When you have an idea in mind, you're already ahead of the competition because you know what you want. They may not, and that's okay! The key is to stay motivated and continue working on it until you've got something good going on. 

2) You will learn more quickly. When you have an idea, your brain starts working overtime trying to come up with a solution.

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.
