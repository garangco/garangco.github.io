Definition of creativity: What makes creativity possible?
Creativity, according to Webster’s Dictionary, is a “ state of being in which the mind is engaged in problem-solving and comes up with new ideas. It is often characterized as a process of creative thinking and creative creation.” In other words, creativity refers to an act or ability that creates new ideas or solutions to old problems. Creative artists are those who are able to express their creative thoughts and feelings through their art.
There are many different definitions of creativity, but one thing they all have in common is that they center around some sort of problem-solving ability. Whether it be coming up with new ideas for products or services, or coming up with ways to solve old problems, creativity is always a key ingredient in any successful business or artistic endeavors. So what makes creativity possible? And how can we become more like creatives?

The power of creativity: What does creativity have to do with success?
Creativity is a key component of success. The ability to come up with new and innovative ideas is what allows people to achieve great things. By definition, creativity is the ability to conceive or come up with new ideas. It can be used for good or bad, but it’s always important in business and life.There are a few things that creativity has to do in order for it to be successful. First, creativity needs to be focused on the task at hand. If it isn’t focused, it will likely go off track. Second, creativity needs to be outlet. This means that it needs a way to get rid of any negative energy or thoughts that are preventing it from working well. Finally, creativity also needs time and effort – both in the form of practice and time itself. Without these three elements, creativity will most likely not result in great success.
