The benefits of creative art
Creative art has been shown to have a number of benefits. These benefits include improved academic performance, mental health, and social skills.
Academic performance is improved when students are exposed to creative art. A study done by the Department of Education found that students who had taken an arts education course had better grades and were more likely to graduate than those who did not take an arts education course. The study also found that students who took an arts education course were more likely to go on to college.

Mental health is improved when people engage in creative art. Art can be used as a form of therapy to help people deal with anxiety, depression, and stress. Art can also help people express themselves in a healthy way.

Social skills are improved when people engage in creative art. Art can help people communicate better and work together more effectively.
