Creativity and art: What are the benefits?
Creativity and art are two of the most important aspects of life. Whether it is working on a painting or writing a story, creativity is needed to create something new. However, there are some disadvantages to having great creativity. First, often times creativity can be difficult to control. Second, with great creativity comes a lot of risk. For example, if you don't have a good eye for color or if you make mistakes while painting, your work might not look as good as it could. But overall, the benefits of creativity far outweigh any negatives. So whether you're looking for an outlet to express yourself or just want to have fun, creative art is worth exploring!

What are the new ideas out there?
In the current political and social climate, there are a number of fresh ideas out there that could change the way we live and work. Here are 5 of them: 
1. A Universal Basic Income: This concept is gaining popularity due to the pressures of mass unemployment and inequality in society. It would provide income to everyone on a sliding scale, with no strings attached.
2. Autonomous Vehicles: This is an idea that has been gaining traction recently due to its potential for reducing traffic congestion and improving public transportation options.

How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.

Stop before you're too far: Sometimes it's better to stop when you're ahead of schedule.
One popular way to avoid becoming too far behind schedule is to take some time off from work and do things you enjoy. This can be done by either creating a plan or just taking a break. Other ideas for dealing with the feeling of being too far behind may include considering using a calendar app to keep track of when you will have other opportunities, setting goals for yourself that you can hit once you've caught up, or using a timer to keep track of how long it will take you to complete a task. When making decisions about when and how to take breaks, it's important to weigh the pros and cons according to what type of work we're doing.
