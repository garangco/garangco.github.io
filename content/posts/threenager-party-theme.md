Exploring the unconscious mind in creative people: How does the subconscious contribute to creativity?
Creative people often have a higher level of awareness and are better equipped to see connections between ideas and the world around them. This can lead to new and more thought-provoking ways of looking at things, which in turn allows them to be more creative. However, it's not just the conscious mind that is responsible for creativity - the unconscious mind also plays a part. The unconscious mind is made up of hidden thoughts, feelings, and memories that we don't usually consider. It's where our creative potential lies - it's where we store all our ideas, inspiration, and dreams. Exploring the unconscious mind in creative people can help them become more aware of their own power and potential to be creative. By understanding how the subconscious helps us to be more creative, they can use their creativity to achieve their goals.

Why are big ideas so important?
Big ideas are the foundation of any great idea, and they can be a driving force behind your innovation. Here are five reasons why big ideas are so important:
1. They build on those that have been done before. A big idea is always new and original, making it easier to come up with new and innovative ideas. This makes it harder for others to copy, which in turn allows you to rest assured that your product or service will be successful.

2. They can help you focus on the right things. When you have a large number of big ideas circling around your head, it can be difficult to know where to start and what to focus on. By having a few big ideas at the forefront of your mind, you can more easily stay focused on whatâ€™s important and get the job done rather than trying too many things at once.

How do you get started with ideas?
Start with a brainstorm. A brainstorm is a process of generating new ideas. It can be used to come up with concepts, products, services, or anything you want to think about. Sometimes you need just a few ideas to get started, and others times you need many different ones to come up with something great. The best way to find out if you need more than one idea is to do some brainstorming yourself.
