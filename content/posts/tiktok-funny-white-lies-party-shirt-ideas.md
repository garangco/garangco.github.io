The importance of ideas
Ideas are the lifeblood of any organization. Without them, a company would be in trouble. They can be used to improve products or to create new ideas for businesses. But even more important, ideas are the engine that drives innovation and growth.
But what are they? How do they come about? And how do they affect our business?

Ideas come from all over the place. Sometimes they come from people who have had some great ideas, and other times they come from others who have had some great ideas but don't know how to put them into a product or service that can make money for the company.

Ideas also come from customers. Sometimes we get an idea from someone who is using our product or service, and sometimes we get an idea from somebody who is not using our product or service but thinks it would be a good idea.

The future of transportation
The future of transportation is anything but what it seems at first glance. The world is about to see a day where people can move around without needing a car, and that’s just the beginning. In fact, many experts say that the days of driving to work or school are numbered. Instead, people will be able to rely on ride-sharing, bikepacking, and other forms of transportation to get around. With these changes in the near future, it will be hard for drivers to remain dominant in the industry.
