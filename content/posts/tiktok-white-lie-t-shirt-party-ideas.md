Conclusion
After months of toiling away on a project, it can be easy to feel like you've lost your creative edge. Fear not! Here are a few tips to help get your creative juices flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to get out of a rut is to take a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This will help you come back to your project with fresh eyes and new ideas.
2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them.
3. Doodle: Sometimes the quickest way to jump start your creativity is simply to start doodling.

Why certain types of creativity are more successful than others?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or organization. They can be used in a number of ways, both for good and bad. Some creative ideas are more successful than others, and there are some factors that play into this success.
Some creative ideas that have been successful include the design of products, the development of new technologies, and the creating of new concepts. Other creative ideas have not been as successful, such as the development of products that are insensitive to user feedback or those that are poorly designed. It is important to consider what type of creativity is being attempted before making a decision on whether or not to pursue it.
