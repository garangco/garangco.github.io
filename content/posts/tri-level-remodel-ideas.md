How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.

Why should someone take a big idea and turn it into a reality?
There are a few reasons why an idea can become something real. Maybe it's because it has the potential to solve a problem people have been dealing with for years, or maybe it's got the potential to change the way people live their lives. Whatever the reason, turning an idea into reality is something that can be difficult but definitely worth doing. Here are three tips on how to make your big idea a reality: 1) think long and hard about what you want your business to achieve, 2) do your research before starting your business, and 3) stay focused on what you want your business to be and not on what others are expecting it to be.
