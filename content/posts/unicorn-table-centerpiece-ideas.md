Bringing Your Invention to Market: Tips on how to get your invention into the hands of consumers.
Inventing something is only half the battle. The other half is getting it out there in front of consumers. Here are a few tips on how to get your invention into the hands of people who will use it.
1. Do your research. Make sure your invention is novel and has a marketable purpose. There's no point in trying to sell something that no one wants or needs.

2. Develop a prototype. This will help you to not only test your invention, but also show it to potential manufacturers, retailers, or investors.

3. Get a patent. This will give you legal protection and help you to commercialize your invention by licensing it to others.

4. Market your invention.

The drawbacks of brainstorming
There are many drawbacks to brainstorming. Brainstorming can lead to groupthink, which is when a group of people come up with ideas that are not very creative or innovative because they all think alike. This can happen because people in the group feel pressure to conform to the majority opinion. Another problem with brainstorming is that it can be very inefficient. A lot of time can be wasted coming up with ideas that are not good, and it can be hard to come up with new ideas if you are stuck on one bad idea. Finally, brainstorming can sometimes create conflict within a group because people may have different opinions about the best way to solve a problem.
