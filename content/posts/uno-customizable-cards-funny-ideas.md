Invention: Limitations of invention
Invention limitations are a key concern for the modern age. Invention has played an important role in human society, and this is only expected to continue as technology advances. However, there are some areas where invention can be limited, which can have a significant impact on the economy and society. One such limitation is that innovation often begins with ideas and not with physical products or services. It is also important to note that new ideas often come from people who are not experts in their field and must work hard to develop them into a product or service that can be used by others.

The role of technology in promoting innovation?
Technology has often been seen as a facilitator of innovation, with the ability to help organizations make faster and more efficient decisions. However, recent studies have shown that technology can also be used in an adversarial role, promoting innovation in the wrong direction. For example, Google was found to be using its search engine to promote its own products instead of those of other companies. In other cases, such as Apple's use of advertising to convince users to buy their products instead of competitors', technology can actually hinder innovation by creating a rift between different factions within an organization.
