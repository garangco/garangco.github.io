Elements of grammar: What is a sentence, and how does it work?
A sentence is an individual unit of communication. It is a group of words that are put together to create a thought or statement. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all share one key feature- they are all complete sentences. There are two main types of sentence- the opening sentence, and the closing sentence. The opening sentence is the beginning of a piece of text, and it sets the tone for the rest of the story. The closing sentence is the end of a piece of text, and it summarizes what has happened so far. There are many different ways to build a sentence, but all preserves these common features: Each word must be completed with a letter from A to Z, and there must be an ending consonant after every other letter. There are also certain rules that govern how words can be spelled- these rules are called grammar rules.

Guidelines for creativity
Creativity is a Keyword for Today's World
There are many ways to be creative and some people believe that creativity is only found in the arts. Others believe that creativity can be found in any activity that leads to new ideas or solutions. The guidelines for being creative are as follows:

1. Be open to new ideas. This means that you should not be afraid to experiment with what you do, even if it does not seem fun or interesting at first. It can result in some great ideas that can help make your work more successful.

2. Allow yourself time and space to brainstorm. It takes time and effort to come up with new ideas, so don't try to do too much at once. Give yourself enough time so that you can come up with several good ones before having to choose one.
