Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It is a journey that begins with a problem that needs to be solved and ends with a solution that is made available to the world. The process of innovation is one that is filled with challenges and uncertainties, but it is also one that can be immensely rewarding. Those who are able to think outside the box and come up with new ways to solve problems are the ones who drive innovation forward.
