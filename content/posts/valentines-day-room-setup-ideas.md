Brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a variety of techniques that can be used in order to generate new ideas. One popular technique is known as brainwriting, which involves writing down ideas on paper or in a digital document. This can be done individually or in a group setting.
Another common brainstorming technique is known as mind mapping. This involves creating a visual representation of ideas, often using colors and images. This can help to stimulate the creative part of the brain and can be used to organize thoughts in a more logical manner.

Lastly, brainstorming can also be done through problem-solving techniques such as SCAMPER. This acronym stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange.

How to start a blog?
If you're looking for ways to start a blog, here are some ideas to get you started. First, consider what kind of content you'd like to create. If you want to share thoughts on your work or politics, then your blog would be focused around that topic. If you want to write about life in general, maybe something like “How I Found My Love for Painting” might be more interesting. Once you have a focus, though, there are a few things to keep in mind when starting a blog. First, make sure your blog is easy to navigate and find. You don't want people trying to find your site by accident while they're browsing the internet; make sure your site is well-marked and easy to navigate. Second, make sure your content is high quality. No one wants to read an article that's full of errors or sparse information.

How to Go about Gathering Ideas: How do you go about gathering them?
It can be tough to come up with ideas, especially when you don't know what you're looking for. However, there are a few things that can help. One is to think about the problem that you want to solve. Something that may help is brainstorming, which can be done by taking a walk or sitting down and thinking about everything that comes to your mind. Then, try coming up with several potential solutions. Another thing to consider is who you want to speak to. You might want someone who knows the industry well or someone who can give you an outsider's perspective on what's going on. Finally, make sure that you have something tangible in mind before starting any brainstorming process. This could be anything from ideas for products or services to pictures or examples of how things might work in practice.
