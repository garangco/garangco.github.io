The different types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is an important part of any artist’s arsenal, and there are various types of creativity that artists use to express themselves. These include: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, gustatory, and emotional. Visual creativity includes making things look beautiful or attractive; auditory creativity includes creating sounds or melodies; kinesthetic creativity includes feeling something through touch or manipulation; gustatory creativity includes eating or drinking something with a taste that stimulates the senses; and emotional creativity involves feeling emotions such as joy, sadness, frustration, anger, and love.
