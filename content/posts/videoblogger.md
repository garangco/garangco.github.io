What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you can always count on. With the right mindset, any big idea can be turned into a successful business venture. So what are some of the most common big ideas? Here are five of the most common:
1. Start with something small. When you have a big goal in mind, it’s easier to focus on smaller steps that will make your dream a reality. This is especially true for businesses – by starting with something small, you can gradually increase your chances of achieving your larger goal.

2. Be persistent. If you want to achieve success, don’t give up until the end. Pounds saved every month will eventually lead to more money in your pocket and more customers coming through your door.

A Big Idea can be anything that inspires someone to think outside the box and come up with a new way of doing things. Sometimes, a Big Idea is something that seems so simple and obvious in hindsight, but it takes someone with a unique perspective to see it.
