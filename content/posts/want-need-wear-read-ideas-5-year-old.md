Development of Invention Theory
Invention theory is the study of how invention happens and why it occurs. It can be used to understand how new products or processes emerge, as well as to predict the success of new businesses. The theory has been used in business, technology, and science for centuries, and it is now being applied to medicine.

What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, hypothesis, or product, typically through creative thought. Invention can be considered a way to improve or create something that already exists. It is also an important part of our economy because without invention, businesses would not be able to create new products and services.

What are the benefits of having big ideas?
Big ideas can have a number of benefits, including making you more creative, sparkling your thinking, and sparking new insights. Here are five reasons why having big ideas is important: 
1. You’ll be more creative: The more you think out loud, the easier it is for your brain to come up with new ideas. When you have big ideas in your head, you’re less likely to be stuck on something and more likely to come up with a solution that meets both your needs and the task at hand. 
2. You’ll be sparkier: If you can see what other people could do better than you, it will make it easier for you to come up with new solutions.
