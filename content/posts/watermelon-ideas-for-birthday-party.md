Mental training is the process of increasing a person's ability to think, focus, and decision-making. There are many reasons to care about mental training, including improving your work performance, increasing your overall well-being, and preventing depression and anxiety. Here are five big ideas about how mental training can benefit you:
1. Improve Your Work Performance: Mental training can help you better focus on tasks at hand and achieve success in your workplace. In a study published in the journal "Personality Psychology," researchers found that people who had learned to think faster were more productive than those who did not. The faster you learn to think, the better prepared you will be for any task that comes your way.

2. Increase Your Overall Well-Being: Mental training has been shown to improve mood and reduce stress levels.

The bottom line: the benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are well-documented and undisputed. Brainstorming allows individuals to generate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and create solutions to problems. Brainstorming also fosters creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.
Despite the clear benefits of brainstorming, many people still hesitate to engage in this type of thinking. One reason for this may be the fear of judgement or criticism. Others may simply not know how to brainstorm effectively.

Fortunately, there are a few simple guidelines that can help make brainstorming more productive and less intimidating. First, it is important to suspend judgement during the brainstorming process. This means that all ideas should be welcomed and explored, no matter how “out there” they may seem at first. Secondly, it is helpful to set a time limit for each brainstorming session.
