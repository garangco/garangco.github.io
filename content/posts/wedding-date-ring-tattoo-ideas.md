Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.

The impact of creativity on art: How does creativity affect the artist?
Creativity is a vital force in the artist’s life. Without creativity, art would be little more than phantasy or dreams. It has been said that creativity is the ability to see things in a new light and to take risks. In order to be truly creative, an artist must have an outlet for their ideas and must be willing to experiment. Some artists rely solely on their own intuition, while others need help from others in order to get started. The impact of creativity on art is complex and difficult to study fully, but there are some general patterns that can be discerned. First and foremost, creativity often leads to innovation and change. This can lead to new ways of looking at old ideas or can result in the discovery of hitherto unknown aspects of the arts. Secondarily, creativity produces fresh perspectives on what has already been done.

Creative abilities: What are they and how do they differ from other abilities?
Creative abilities can be defined in many different ways, but the most commonly accepted definition is that creativity is a quality or state of being that enables people to come up with new and innovative ideas. This ability can differ from person to person, but typically it refers to a spark of inspiration or an idea that comes to mind.
There are several different ways creative abilities can be measured, including creative thinking tests and creative writing exercises. However, the most common way to measure creativity is through art or poetry.
