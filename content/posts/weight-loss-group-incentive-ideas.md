How do you come up with big ideas?
How do you come up with big ideas? There are a few methods that can be used to come up with big ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when you come up with a list of ideas and then try to come up with the best one. Another method is by doing mockups or prototypes, which are simulations of what an idea could look like. Finally, there’s coming up with solutions to problems, which can be anything from developing a new product to creating a new way of doing business. All of these methods can help you come up with some great ideas, but it all starts with having the right mindset and setting goals.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
When it comes to innovation, there are a few key differences that can be observed. For one, innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas or products; it also includes taking risks and trying something new in order to create something better.
