The future of inventions: What needs to be done in order for new inventions to thrive?
Inventions have always been a part of humanity’s history, but as the world has become more complex, so too has the need for new inventions. This is especially true in today’s world, where technology is constantly evolving and becoming more advanced. In order for new inventions to thrive, however, there are several key things that need to be done. 
One of the most important things that needs to be done is to make sure that new inventions are passed on from one generation to the next. This can be done by creating a system where people can share ideas for new inventions with each other, and then testing and dubbing them into products or services. It also helps to create a market for these products or services by attracting investors who can help to bring these products or services to market quickly.

The role of big ideas in history
The role of big ideas in history is essential for understanding the past and shaping the future. Big ideas have the power to change the course of history, and they often do. From the American Revolution to the civil rights movement, big ideas have shaped our world.
Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Some are small and only affect a few people, while others are large and have a global impact. No matter their size, all big ideas have the potential to change the world.

History is full of examples of big ideas that have changed the course of events. The American Revolution was sparked by a few key individuals who had big ideas about freedom and democracy. These ideas spread like wildfire, eventually leading to independence from Britain.

The civil rights movement was another example of a big idea changing history.
