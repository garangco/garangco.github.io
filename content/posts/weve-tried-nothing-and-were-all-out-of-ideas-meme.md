Why and how do people come up with new invention ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different sources, both within and outside of the inventor themselves. Sometimes, an idea is sparked by something that the inventor sees or hears. Other times, someone else has an idea that the inventor thinks could be improved. In either case, it is important to find out why the inventor came up with the idea in the first place and how they went about making it a reality.

Types of Ideas: What are some types of creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come in many forms. Some are more creative than others, but all have potential to yield some great ideas. Here are some types of creative ideas:
1. Conceptualization: This is the process of formulating a plan or idea and then coming up with a reasonable implementation. It can be done in a number of ways, but the most common is to start with an outline and work from there.

2. Design: Design is the manifestation of ideas. It can be something as simple as adding color or elements to an existing piece of furniture, or as complex as developing a new style for a product or company.

3. Technology: Technology has always had a huge impact on creativity, from improving communication to helping us create new ideas. There are endless possibilities when it comes to using technology to help increase creativity.

Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.
