Ideas are the lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we might just as well give up.

How to have big ideas
The ability to have big ideas is a skill that can be learned and cultivated. Here are some tips on how to have big ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas and perspectives. Don't be afraid to explore different viewpoints and challenge your own assumptions.

2. Pay attention to your surroundings and the world around you. Look for patterns and connections that you may not have noticed before.

3. Be willing to take risks. Big ideas often come from thinking outside the box and taking risks. So don't be afraid to try something new or different.

4. Be persistent and never give up. Many great ideas come after many failed attempts. So keep trying and never give up on your dreams or goals.

5. Surround yourself with other creative people.
