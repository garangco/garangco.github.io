How to do brainstroming effectively
Picture a room full of people, all focused on one task. They are all working together towards a common goal. This is the brainstroming effect, or the power of team work.
The brainstroming effect works because people's brains are tuned to multi-tasking. When we're focusing on one task, our attention span is limited and it takes longer for our brain to process information. This can lead to confusion and a lack of focus.

However, if we switch our focus away from the task at hand, our brains are more likely to revert back to their normal processing speed and be more productive once again. In fact, science has found that when we switch our focus away from a task for just a few seconds, the speed of our brainstems activity decreases by 50%.
