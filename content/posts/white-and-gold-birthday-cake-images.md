History of Invention: How did invention come about?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that had not been considered before. Invention has been around for centuries, and it began with the Greeks. In their manual The Iliad, Homer mentions the invention of the bow and arrow, which he says was created by Menelaus. Other ancient authors also mention the invention of new technologies. For example, Theophrastus wrote about a machine that could turn any object into wine, which he called the “Wine Maker”. The Chinese also invented various products such as silkworm cocoons and books in the 4th century BC.
