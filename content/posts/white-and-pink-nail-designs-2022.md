Historical Background of Invention: From ancient Greece to the American Revolution.
Invention is the act of bringing a new product to the market, or making a change in an old product so that it can be successful. It is often credited to individuals, gangs, and governments who come up with new ideas for fixing things or improving society. Invention has been a part of human history for as long as people have been able to think about it. The ancient Greeks were the first to develop inventive minds and come up with new products. They invented everything from farming tools to missiles. Inventions played an important role in the development of civilizations and the rise of republics. The American Revolution was also led by inventors, including Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.

The definition of creativity: What is creativity?
Creativity is an important word. It has been used to describe many different things in the past, but its meaning has changed over time. In ancient Greece, creativity was defined as making something new. This idea wasn't widely accepted by people at that time, but it is still used today. In the modern world, creativity is often used to describe how something can be done or how something can be created. However, there is no one definition of creativity. There are many different ways to think about creativity, and each person has their own definition. Some people define creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others may think of it as the ability to see things differently orto come up with unique solutions to problems. Still others may believe that creativity isn't about anything specific but simply creative thought and problem solving.

Business: How do you make money from invention ideas?
If you're an inventor, there are a few things you need to keep in mind if you want to make some money from your invention ideas. 
First, it's important to come up with interesting and novel ideas that have potential market value. In order to get your idea accepted by the public, you'll need to supply clear evidence that your product or service is better than the competition.

Second, do your research before starting a business. Make sure you understand what kind of expenses associated with developing and selling your product or service and how much money you'll actually be making from each sale.

Finally, be prepared for long hours and plenty of travel (especially if your idea involves selling products or services online). This isn't easy work - but it's definitely worth it when it comes to making money from your invention ideas!
