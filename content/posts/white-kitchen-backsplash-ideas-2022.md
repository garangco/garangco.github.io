What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.
