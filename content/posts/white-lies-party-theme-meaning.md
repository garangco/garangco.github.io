Immigration and Customs Enforcement: What changes will need to be made to deal with this growing problem?
The number of people apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has increased by 50 percent in just five years, according to a report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The report also found that CBP is struggling with the increasing number of asylum seekers and refugees, as well as its own staffing shortages.
One solution to the problem may be to consider changes to how the agency handles immigration. One idea would be to relax requirements for criminal background checks on those seeking entry into the country, which can lead to more individuals being admitted without proper vetting. Another idea would be to increase funding for CBP so that it can properly patrol the country's borders and handle operations like search and seizure in more efficient ways.
