Marketing: How to market your invention idea
Assuming you have an invention idea and want to market it, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it's important to do your research and understand both the industry and your potential customers. Who is your target market? What needs does your product address? How does your product compare to other similar products on the market? Once you have a solid understanding of these things, you can begin developing a marketing strategy.
There are a number of ways to go about marketing your invention idea. One option is to sell directly to companies who may be interested in manufacturing or distributing your product. Another option is to work with an invention marketing firm who can help you patent and protect your idea and then market it to potential buyers. Whichever route you choose, be sure to put together a strong pitch that highlights the need for your product and how it benefits consumers.

legal aspects of Invention: What are the rules surrounding invention?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea,product or method. It can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that invention is "the creation of something new out of nothing." Many countries have laws that regulate the creation and use of inventions. In some cases, these laws are more important than others, and they can play a decisive role in whether an invention becomes a commercial success.
There are three types of law governing invention: trade secrets, copyrights and patents.trade secrets usually relate to technology or business ideas, while copyrights protect creative works such as novels, motion pictures and computer programs. Patents allow inventors to exclusive use their ideas for a period of time, which can make it difficult for other people to adopt or use an invention.
