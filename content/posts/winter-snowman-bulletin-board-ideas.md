Tips For Creating More Effective Art: What tips can you give to help improve your artwork?
When it comes to creating effective art, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some tips that may help improve your work:

3. Be persistent. The best way to stay motivated when painting or sculpture is to keep pushing yourself.
