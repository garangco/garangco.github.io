How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.

Idea 2: Reflect on your favorite memories
What are your favorite memories? What makes them so special? What do they make you feel on a deep level? These are all good questions to ask yourself, and the answers will help you shape your ideas into something truly unique. Here are a few examples: 
1. One of my favorite memories is of when I was a little girl and my family went on an overnight camping trip. It was such an amazing experience to be with my parents and see the country in all its glory. It still makes me emotional to think about it now. 
2. Another great memory from childhood is going skating with my friends in our local park. skating on winter days was one of the best things ever! Even though it's been years since that experience, I can still feel the excitement and happiness that came along with it.
