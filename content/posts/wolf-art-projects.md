What are big ideas?
Big ideas can be defined in many ways, but one way is as the thinking that takes a larger than average perspective on an individual situation or event. These ideas come to mind when we encounter something unique or when we are brainstorming new ideas. Big ideas can help us see the best way to approach a problem, think outside the box, or come up with new solutions.

Now that electricity prices have been high for a while and there are more efficient ways to use power, it’s important to keep an eye on your energy bill and figure out what you can do to save money.

Examples ofDIY projects
How to make a quilt top
A quilt top is an easy and versatile project that can be completed in a few hours or even less. There are many different ways to do this project, so there is no need to be afraid of experimentation. Here are some examples: 

-You can use batting or fabric scraps to create the fabric backing for your quilt top. This will add some extra stability and durability to your finished product. 
-You can easily make using pie crusts instead of batting or fabric scraps. Just cut out the dough and place it in a greased pie dish. Freeze for 30 minutes or until solidified. Cut out the desired designs and place them on the pie crusts. 
-You can also use whipped cream as a filling for your quilt top.
