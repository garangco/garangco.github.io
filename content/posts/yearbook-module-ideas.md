Invention as a process: How does one come up with new ideas?
One important step in the process of coming up with new ideas is to have a brainstorm. A brainstorming session is an opportunity for individuals to come up with new ideas without having to worry about whether or not they will be accepted. By using a brainstorming session, you can quickly and easily come up with new ideas that could potentially solve a problem. 
The best way to create a good brainstorming session is by creating a agenda beforehand and setting boundaries for who can participate. You should also make sure that everyone has something they are willing to share, so that everyone has an equal say in the discussion. It is important to do this because it will help free up energy and allow everyone to focus on their individual Ideas rather than worrying about how others might react. Once you have started the meeting, it’s important to give everyone some time before taking any decisions.

The Future of Healthcare: How will we keep our citizens healthy?
As we work to look into the future of healthcare, we must consider many different ideas. One idea that we could consider is having a system where citizens can access health care on-demand. This would mean that patients and doctors would be able to talk with one another directly, and would not have to go through a bureaucracy. Another idea is having healthcare vouchers which could be used to pay for medical services out of pocket. This would help ensure that people are able to get the best care possible while staying healthy. Other ideas include increasing access to mental health services, ensuring that everyone has access to quality education, and creating more affordable healthcare options. All of these ideas are important in order to keep our citizens healthy and safe.
