Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.

Invention and Technology
Invention and technology have brought many benefits over the years, including making life easier and improving our quality of life. However, sometimes these advancements can be dangerous, leading to new ways of harming people or other animals. For example, scientists have come up with a novel way to reuse metal objects by using a heat treatment process to make them incredibly strong and durable. This process can result in objects that are more resistant to breakage and are also more resistant to being used in dangerous situations.
